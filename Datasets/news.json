The bill streamlines the testing and deployment of autonomous vehicles in the U.S., said backer Rep. Bob Latta (R-Ohio).  Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), ranking member of the committee, said the bill was not perfect, and he would have preferred no federal preemption of state autonomous vehicle safety regs, but said they had been able to narrow the preemption. He also pointed out the bill requires cybersecurity practices be in place before a car is sold.  Chairman Greg Walden (R-Ore.) said the bipartisan bill was an example of the committee \"at its best—working together to pursue the common goal of saving lives.\"  Pallone said there was still much work to be done, including how the bill's provisions would be implemented, but said he was committed to the bill so long as safety is the top priority, which Walden has said it must be.  Latta said the committee had some 250 meetings with stakeholders to get to the point of being able to approve the bill and echoed the mantra that the priority would be safety, \"first, last and always,\" he added.  He said that since the draft of the bill was marked up last week, there have been added provisions, including on cybersecurity protection.  Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.) called it a historic markup. She had called for a bipartisan bill back when the legislation was introduced in subcommittee, so she was pleased and said the bill was a significant improvement over the original draft.  Preemption remained a big sticking point for some.  “Pre-empting the states’ ability to fill the gap left by federal inaction on safety standards leaves us at the mercy of manufacturers as they use our public highways as their private laboratories however they wish with no safety protections at all,” said John Simpson, privacy project director for Consumer Watchdog.  The group wants mandatory privacy, security, safety, and even ethical standards for AVs."},{"url":"https://www.upi.com/Sports_News/NFL/2017/07/27/NFL-camp-openings-Cincinnati-Bengals-bad-boys-fight-for-jobs/7551501202440/","title":"NFL camp openings: Cincinnati Bengals' bad boys fight for jobs - UPI.com","short_content":"CINCINNATI -- Even as the Cincinnati Bengals gathered their full roster for training camp here Thursday (July 27), offseason troubles loomed despite efforts to move past them.\nBut, he's expected to be ready for training camp.\nBackups - DT Andrew Billings, DT DeShawn Williams, DE Jordan Willis, DT Marcus Hardison, DE Will Clarke, DE Wallace Gilberry, DT Brandon Thompson, DT Ryan Glasgow, DT David Dean, DE Chris Smith.\nBillings missed his entire rookie season due to injury, but appears to be full go for training camp.\nHead coach Marvin Lewis was pleased with Bullock's production, but said there will be competition at kicker in training camp.","content":"CINCINNATI -- Even as the Cincinnati Bengals gathered their full roster for training camp here Thursday (July 27), offseason troubles loomed despite efforts to move past them.  Talented, but oft-troubled cornerback Adam Jones, is suspended for the first week of the season for violating the league's personal conduct policy when he reportedly spat in the face of a jailhouse nurse in January and his penalty was limited to two days served.  For Jones, 33, this was his seventh arrest and third off-field incident since joining the Bengals. And, regardless of his dynamic achievements on the field in the past, his timing may be bad. Second-year corner William Jackson III sat out last season with an injury, but is ready and eager to get a chance to start. Jones is giving him that chance.  At the other corner, Dre Kirkpatrick recovered from a hand fracture during the offseason and is expected to be 100 percent.  Meanwhile, former Oklahoma running back Joe Mixon was rated with first-round talent, but fell to the Bengals in the second round because he was unable to outrun a domestic abuse incident in college. Regardless, Mixon shed 10 pounds since the Indianapolis Scouting Combine (which he prohibited from attending) and appears ready to challenge for a starting job immediately.  Incumbent running back Jeremy Hill had two subpar seasons, but insists he's motivated to return to his 2014 form when he rushed for more than 1,100 yards as a rookie.  Lack of a consistent running game was partly responsible for quarterback Andy Dalton being sacked 41 times last season, And, with a revamped offensive line needing help, too, finding someone to step up in the backfield is a priority for Cincinnati during training camp.  THE FACTS:  TRAINING CAMP: Paul Brown Stadium; Cincinnati, OH  COACH: Marvin Lewis  15th season as Bengals/NFL head coach  118-110-3 overall; 0-7 postseason  THE BREAKDOWN  2016 finish: 3rd AFC North (6-9-1)  STATISTICS  TOTAL OFFENSE: 356.9 (13th)  RUSHING: 110.6 (13th)  PASSING: 246.4 (15th)  TOTAL DEFENSE: 350.8 (17th)  RUSHING: 113.3 (21st)  PASSING: 237.5 (11th)  2017 PRESEASON SCHEDULE  All times Eastern  Aug. 11, TAMPA BAY (Fri), 7:30  Aug. 19, KANSAS CITY (Sat), 7:00  Aug. 27, at Washington, 4:30  Aug. 31, at Indianapolis (Thu), 7:00  UNIT-BY-UNIT ANALYSIS  QUARTERBACKS: Starter - Andy Dalton. Backups - AJ McCarron, Jeff Driskel.  Dalton had his best season despite a suspect line, inconsistent running game, and injuries to key veteran players. He passed for 4,206 yards and 18 TDs with just eight interceptions despite being sacked 41 times. Dalton also completed 64.7 percent of his passes to reach the 4,000-yard mark for the second time in his career. McCarron was the focus of trade rumors during the offseason but for now remains a Bengal.  RUNNING BACKS: Starter - Jeremy Hill. Backups - Joe Mixon, Giovani Bernard, Cedric Peerman, Tra Carson, Stanley Williams.  Mixon was a controversial draft choice, but he has a legitimate shot to assume the starting role. Hill is coming off a couple subpar seasons and Bernard missed the final six games with an ACL tear. The Bengals need more production from the running game to take pressure off Dalton and a revamped offensive line.  TIGHT ENDS: Starter - Tyler Eifert. Backups - C.J. Uzomah, Tyler Kroft, Ryan Hewitt, Mason Schreck.  Eifert underwent back surgery during the offseason and worked on the side during the spring. But, he's expected to be ready for training camp. Kroft was impressive during spring workouts and is expected to compete for the backup role that mostly belonged to Uzomah last season. An ankle injury suffered in the Pro Bowl resulted in surgery and caused Eifert to miss the first four weeks. The back injury then delayed his return until the seventh game. Eifert had 29 catches for 394 yards and five touchdowns before the back issues resurfaced.  WIDE RECEIVERS: Starters - A.J. Green, Brandon LaFell, Tyler Boyd. Backups - John Ross, Cody Core, Josh Malone, Alex Erickson, Jake Kumerow, Alonzo Russell, Chris Brown.  This group is deep and versatile with the addition of speedy rookie Ross and the tall, physical Malone. Green missed the final six games with a hamstring injury and fell 36 yards shy of reaching 1,000 yards for the sixth straight season, something only Randy Moss has done. But, the five-time Pro Bowler proved himself to be healthy during the spring. LaFell says he's more comfortable going into his second season with the team.  OFFENSIVE LINEMEN: Starters - LT Cedric Ogbuehi, RT Jake Fisher, C Russell Bodine, RG Andre Smith, LG Clint Boling. Backups - LT Landon Lechler, LG Trey Hopkins, C T.J, Johnson, RG Christian Westerman, LG Dustin Stanton, LG Cameron Lee, RG Alex Redmond, LG Kent Perkins.  This group is among the biggest questions heading into the 2017 season, especially after veteran left tackle Andre Whitworth left as a free agent after 12 seasons and leaving a significant leadership void in the locker room. Another veteran, guard Kevin Zeitler, also is gone. Smith was brought back to play guard. Ogbuehi struggled most of last season, even briefly moving to left tackle where he said he was more comfortable. But, the results were the same. His weaknesses in pass protection were partly responsible for Dalton being sacked 41 times last season.  DEFENSIVE LINEMEN: Starters - LDE Carlos Dunlap, DT Geno Atkins, RDE Michael Johnson, LDT Pat Sims. Backups - DT Andrew Billings, DT DeShawn Williams, DE Jordan Willis, DT Marcus Hardison, DE Will Clarke, DE Wallace Gilberry, DT Brandon Thompson, DT Ryan Glasgow, DT David Dean, DE Chris Smith.  Domata Peko left in free agency. Billings missed his entire rookie season due to injury, but appears to be full go for training camp. Dunlap had eight sacks and Atkins had nine, but the Bengals' pass rush wasn't as ferocious as in recent years. Willis was drafted in the third round out of Kansas State and is widely considered a steal for the Bengals.  LINEBACKERS: Starters - MLB Vincent Rey, SLB Marquis Flowers, WLB Vontaze Burfict. Backups - MLB Kevin Minter, SLB Carl Lawson, SLB P.J. Dawson, WLB Nick Vigil, SLB Bryson Albright, SLB Jordan Evans.  Veterans Rey Maualuga and Karlos Dansby left via free agency. Minter was signed to provide some experience and could assume Maualuga's role in the middle. Vigil had a solid offseason. Burfict finished second on the team in tackles despite missing the first three games of the season due to suspension. He was in better shape this summer and the Bengals look for big things if he can avoid the extracurriculars.  DEFENSIVE BACKS: Starters - LCB Dre Kirkpatrick, RCB Adam Jones, SS Shawn Williams, FS George Iloka. Backups - RCB Josh Shaw, RCB KeiVarae Russell, RCB Darqueze Dennard, SS Clayton Fejedelem, FS Derron Smith, CB William Jackson, RCB Brandon Wilson, LCB Tony McRae, LCB Bene Benwikere.  Kirkpatrick drew praise from the coaching staff for his improvement this season, but Jackson, the team's top draft choice a year ago, is expected to recover after being injured late in training camp and will push for a starting role next year. Jones is among the team captains and emotional leaders, but his arrest just days after the conclusion of the regular season puts his future in doubt. Jones faced multiple charges for his conduct at a local hotel.  SPECIAL TEAMS: K Randy Bullock, P Kevin Huber, PR Adam Jones, KOR Alex Erickson, LS Clark Harris, K Jake Elliott, K Jon Brown.  The journeyman Bullock was signed when veteran Mike Nugent was released after missing six extra points. Head coach Marvin Lewis was pleased with Bullock's production, but said there will be competition at kicker in training camp. Elliott was drafted out of the University of Memphis and was impressive during OTAs. Erickson led the NFL with 810 kickoff return yards including one 84-yarder."},{"url":"http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/opinion/20170727/letter-payment-will-be-used-for-unpopular-bullet-train","title":"Letter: Payment will be used for unpopular bullet train - Santa Cruz Sentinel","short_content":"If California stopped all emissions, the new coal plants in Pakistan and India would probably offset that reduction immediately.\nWhat the extension does is force a payment for everything that is made or moved in California and then uses a large portion of the income to fund the unpopular bullet train to nowhere.\nThis is a tax that is not a tax — the nonpartisan legislative analyst office says this will add $0.63 to the cost of a gallon of gas by 2021 — but hey the bullet train will get funded.\n— Jim Lindsey, SoquelThe Sentinel welcomes your letters to the editor.\nOccasionally, we reject letters simply because we’ve had so many on the same subject.","content":"I think your editorial admiring Gov.

Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Brian Schatz of Hawaii told an audience at the American Enterprise Institute the bill would raise $2.1 trillion in federal revenue over 10 years by requiring companies to pay $49 per ton of carbon emissions next year, a figure that would increase annually.  \"The idea is quite simple: Unleash markets to tackle climate change,\" said Schatz. \"It establishes incentives that allow capital to flow and businesses to thrive when they can use clean energy, letting the free market compete and innovate and make profits.\"  The carbon tax would cut CO2 emissions 36 percent below 2005 levels by 2025.  \"Climate change is real and urgent,\" said Whitehouse. \"This carbon fee would produce meaningful reductions in emissions.\"  A number of companies like BP, Royal Dutch Shell, PepsiCo and Walmart had backed the carbon taxes plan in February. The senators said large companies could be the game-changer to sway some Republicans to support their plan.  Several Republicans and business leaders -- including former Treasury Secretaries Hank Paulson and James Baker -- are said to have met with some of President Donald Trump's top advisers at the White House in February to push the plan, even before the bill was drafted.  Last year, then-candidate Trump and a majority of the House opposed the same tax when it was proposed. With a 237-163 vote, the GOP lawmakers said such a tax would be harmful to American families and businesses, and would not be in the best interest of the United States.  The concept also runs contrary to Trump's promises to help bring back coal-mining jobs.  \"Sen. Schatz and I extend an open hand -- an olive branch. Find Sen. Schatz and me a Republican to negotiate with. Then, let's talk about the economics, let's talk about the revenue,\" Whitehouse said.  Schatz said carbon taxes could be the source of revenue that Republicans need to implement their goals for tax reform.  \"Let's restart the bipartisan conversation,\" said Whitehouse."},{"url":"http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-40744052","title":"Scots and Welsh ministers meet to discuss Brexit concerns - BBC News","short_content":"Image caption Mike Russell and Mark Drakeford met in Cardiff to discuss Brexit legislationScottish and Welsh government ministers have met in Cardiff to discuss opposition to UK Brexit legislation.\nThe two devolved administrations have said they cannot recommend consent be given to the EU Withdrawal Bill.\nScottish Brexit minister Mike Russell and Welsh Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford said their governments would resist any attempt to take away powers.\nUK junior Brexit minister Robin Walker called for a \"grown up conversation\" between the governments over the plans.\nThe UK government says the devolved legislatures will actually gain powers as a result of the UK leaving the EU.","content":"Image caption Mike Russell and Mark Drakeford met in Cardiff to discuss Brexit legislation  Scottish and Welsh government ministers have met in Cardiff to discuss opposition to UK Brexit legislation.  The two devolved administrations have said they cannot recommend consent be given to the EU Withdrawal Bill.  Scottish Brexit minister Mike Russell and Welsh Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford said their governments would resist any attempt to take away powers.  UK junior Brexit minister Robin Walker called for a \"grown up conversation\" between the governments over the plans.  Mr Walker, who is in Scotland for a two-day visit, said the legislation would ultimately increase the power of the devolved legislatures.  'Respect devolution'  Joining Mr Russell and Mr Drakeford at the meetings were the two administrations' top lawyers, Scotland's Lord Advocate James Wolffe and Welsh Counsel General Mick Antoniw.  The two governments have coordinated recent opposition to the UK government, issuing joint statements on matters including the Withdrawal Bill and entering a formal dispute resolution process over regional funding in light of the £1bn Conservative-DUP deal.  The repeal bill converts current EU laws onto the UK statute book, but has been decried as a \"naked power-grab\" by the Scottish and Welsh first ministers, Nicola Sturgeon and Carwyn Jones.  They fear that powers over areas such as agriculture and fishing, currently devolved but exercised at a European level, will ultimately return to Westminster rather than being passed on to Edinburgh and Cardiff.

Image copyright PA Image caption Scottish government ministers have voiced fears that Brexit could see powers taken away from Holyrood  Mr Russell said the administrations \"cannot and will not stand by and let powers in devolved areas be taken by the UK government\", saying the legislation \"must be changed to respect devolution\".  The SNP MSP said: \"It's going against the interests of Wales and Scotland, against their people, against the progress we want to make with the economy. We have to stop that happening.  \"That's why the first ministers from the two countries gave what is an unprecedented joint statement when the EU Withdrawal Bill was published.  \"The work we're doing today is making sure we're working together to try to persuade the UK government that their approach is simply wrong, and will not work, and has to change.\"  'Maximise impact'  Labour AM Mr Drakeford added: \"On a series of issues related to Brexit, there's a strong identity of interests between the Welsh government and the Scottish government, between what matters to people in Wales and what matters to people in Scotland.  \"By sharing information and working together, we can maximise our impact on the UK government's thinking.\"  Image caption Robin Walker is in Scotland to meet business leaders to discuss Brexit  However Mr Walker said it was necessary to have some common frameworks in order to conduct future negotiations with the EU, and to preserve the market within the UK.

The Institute for Fiscal Studies said that the future of food prices will remain “highly uncertain” until the outcome of trade negotiations is known.  If no free trade deal between the UK and the EU is agreed before the March 2019 divorce date, the UK will trade under World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules. In this scenario food prices are likely to rise “significantly”, according to the think tank.  It pointed out that the UK would not be able to set tariffs that discriminate between its various trading partners, except as part of a free trade agreement or to give developing countries special access to its market.  This means the the UK would have to place tariffs on EU imports unless it chose to charge zero tariffs to all WTO members - an option which is seen as highly unlikely.  Tariffs would raise the price of food imported from the EU and the bloc accounts for 70 per cent of the UK’s gross food imports, the IFS said.  Food will be more vulnerable to tariff increases than other sectors because around 30 per cent of the value of food purchased by households in the UK is imported, compared to just 17 per cent of overall consumer spending, according to the IFS’ figures.  The UK could mitigate the effects of tariff barriers by accepting cheaper food imports that do not meet current EU standards, it said.

In addition, MEMA has joined the Coalition for Future Mobility, which seeks to realize the safety, social, economic and environmental benefits that will come with automated vehicles.”"},{"url":"https://siliconangle.com/blog/2017/07/27/smart-cities-share-data-enhance-autonomous-vehicle-capabilities-autotech/","title":"Smart cities share data to enhance autonomous vehicle capabilities - SiliconANGLE News (blog)","short_content":"Smart cities are playing a big part in aiding the growth of self-driving cars by providing additional sensor data to enhance vehicle safety and navigation.\nIn order to facilitate the transfer of information from the smart cities to data consumers, Christian Kotscher (pictured), founder and chief executive officer of MetroTech Net Inc., started a company that is building a real-time traffic data exchange.\n“We go to existing cities and counties and take their existing sensors to bring them into our cloud-based system, where we convert them into real-time traffic data.\nWe’re basically setting up the necessary data exchange that allows smarter cities to speak with autonomous vehicles and connected cars,” Kotscher said.\nModernizing data generated by smart citiesA large component of the data coming onto MetroTech’s exchange comes from existing sensor deployments stemming from smart city initiatives.","content":"Smart cities are playing a big part in aiding the growth of self-driving cars by providing additional sensor data to enhance vehicle safety and navigation. In order to facilitate the transfer of information from the smart cities to data consumers, Christian Kotscher (pictured), founder and chief executive officer of MetroTech Net Inc., started a company that is building a real-time traffic data exchange.  “We go to existing cities and counties and take their existing sensors to bring them into our cloud-based system, where we convert them into real-time traffic data. … What we do on the exchange is we publish it out to not just the cities, but also the people driving on their streets. We’re basically setting up the necessary data exchange that allows smarter cities to speak with autonomous vehicles and connected cars,” Kotscher said.  Kotscher spoke with Jeff Frick (@JeffFrick), host of theCUBE, SiliconANGLE Media’s mobile livestreaming studio, during this year’s Auto Tech Council – Innovation in Motion event in Milpitas, California. They discussed the data exchange Metrotech is building. (* Disclosure below.)  Modernizing data generated by smart cities  A large component of the data coming onto MetroTech’s exchange comes from existing sensor deployments stemming from smart city initiatives. This data, however, is often not ready to be consumed by modern applications in connected vehicles.  “If you look at open data initiatives in San Francisco or New York, what they were doing was just putting a bunch of spreadsheets online. That’s open but not useful,” Kotscher said. “There’s data we’ve got to get out of the cabinets back at the city hall, back into the traffic management centers, but then we’ve got to publish it out, and those standards have not been written.”  As more of the data already being generated is pulled onto the exchange, consumers can apply modern techniques, such as machine learning, to extract more value from the original data set, Kotscher explained.  “Every city has a significant amount of infrastructure already out there, especially in the way of cameras. … Right now the police will use them for stakeouts and traffic … will use them to respond to accidents. … We take that video analytics into our engine … and we’ve got examples of that in some of the smarter cities,” Kotscher stated.

While the bill has broad bipartisan support, at issue are provisions in the bill that would pre-empt state laws – ostensibly to keep states from drawing up their own set of safety standards.  The goal of the bill is to avoid fifty safety standards for autonomous vehicles in fifty states – a noble goal. Automakers can’t create fifty different versions of their cars to adhere to fifty state standards.  However, the bill could also theoretically up-end state laws that govern motor vehicle operation, which has a number of groups concerned. Consumer groups are worried about whether the law would end state lemon laws. Insurance companies are focused on state insurance regulations. Local car dealerships are concerned about state motor vehicle franchise laws.  Automobiles are one of the most regulated products in America today, with the federal government regulating some aspects, and state governments regulating other aspects. A rule of thumb is to think of “what’s in” the car as being a federal issue (safety standards, emission standards, etc.), while “who’s operating” the car as a state issue (drivers’ licenses, registrations, insurance and liability, sales and service).  The issue Congress is tacking is complex because, in theory at least, AV operation is not necessarily by a person and could thus be considered “what’s in” a car – and thus regulated federally, instead of by the state. At least unless you start issuing drivers licenses to robots!  Congress is right to consider pre-empting state or local laws that, in the future, might tinker with safety standards. We can’t have Maine, for example, requiring that all autonomous vehicles be 4x4s, or California requiring that all AVs run on hydrogen.  But at the same time, Congress needs to be careful not to upend our federalist system with an unnecessarily over-broad law – especially in areas where the states do a far better job regulating than the federal government ever could.  There is no reason why a bill designed to clear the way to get AVs up and running should in any way up-end state laws regarding licensing or registration, both of which are responsibly regulated at the state level. Nor should Congress pre-empt how states regulate the sale and service of cars and trucks through motor vehicle franchise laws, which are firmly in the purview of the states. As former Deputy Attorney General Peter Ferrara has noted, these laws exist because local dealerships are prohibited from collectively negotiating their franchise contracts with manufacturers. The governors and legislatures deal with these issues in every legislative session, know what they are doing, and any changes to these laws should come from the states – not impromptu action from Washington.  Bottom line, the purpose of the AV legislation going through congress this week are to make it possible for automakers to build great new technologically advanced autonomous vehicles. That’s the whole point, so Congress should take care to keep the legislation to just that and not upend states’ rights with an overly broad bill that unnecessarily cedes more power to Washington.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An influential U.S. House committee on Thursday approved a revised bipartisan bill on a 54-0 vote that would speed the deployment of self-driving cars without human controls and bar states from blocking autonomous vehicles.  The bill would allow automakers to obtain exemptions to deploy up to 25,000 vehicles without meeting existing auto safety standards in the first year, a cap that would rise to 100,000 vehicles annually over three years.  Automakers and technology companies believe chances are good Congress will approve legislation before year end. They have been pushing for regulations making it easier to deploy self-driving technology, while consumer groups have sought more safeguards. Current federal rules bar self-driving cars without human controls on U.S. roads and automakers think proposed state rules in California are too restrictive.  The measure, the first significant federal legislation aimed at speeding self-driving cars to market, would require automakers to submit safety assessment reports to regulators, but would not require pre-market approval of advanced vehicle technologies.  The House of Representatives will take up the bill when it reconvenes in September, while senators plan to introduce a separate similar measure.  \"Our aim was to develop a regulatory structure that allows for industry to safely innovate with significant government oversight,\" said Representative Greg Walden, who chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee.  Initially, authors proposed to allow automakers and others to sell up to 100,000 vehicles immediately. Representative Frank Pallone said the phase-in period was essential so \"millions of exempted cars will not hit our roads all at once.\"  Manufacturers must demonstrate self-driving cars winning exemptions are at least as safe as existing vehicles.  Under the House proposal, states could still set rules on registration, licensing, liability, insurance and safety inspections, but could not set self-driving car performance standards.  Automakers praised committee passage, while Consumer Watchdog privacy director John Simpson said preempting state laws \"leaves us at the mercy of manufacturers as they use our public highways as their private laboratories.\"  General Motors Co (GM.N), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Tesla Inc (TSLA.O), Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) and others have been lobbying for legislation to speed deployment of self-driving cars. Consumer advocates want more changes, including giving the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration quicker access to crash data and more funding to oversee self-driving cars.

But will help arrive in time? \"That's a very good question,” says Jose Avila of German car component giant Continental.  The company heavily modified a VW Golf diesel to show that detox is feasible. Continental's choice of car makes sense. The discovery of emissions-cheating software in VW by US researchers started the Dieselgate stink in September 2015.  Diesel is declining in popularity in Australia. To the end of June, diesel SUV sales to private buyers fell by 3700, or almost 10 per cent - and sales of diesel cars to private buyers were even worse, falling by more than 23 per cent in the same period.  Diesel cars don't sell nearly as well as diesel SUVs, so the number of lost diesel sales in this case is much smaller.  Avila believes a comeback with the consumer is possible. \"It is hard to advertise or push the diesel when there is still some clean-up to do, literally,” says the engines and transmissions boss. \"(By 2019) there's going to be a lot more promotion for the diesel, demonstrating you can clean it.”  Avila thinks it's too early to tell whether the erosion of diesel's market share is unstoppable. The lower CO2 emissions of diesel vehicles compared to petrol-burners remains a strong point so \"it should allow for a comeback or at least a stabilisation of the market share”.  The diesel engine's problem has never been CO2. Its lower fuel consumption means lower emissions of this major greenhouse gas.  Instead the problem is NOx (oxides of nitrogen), the health-harming pollutant emitted in much smaller quantities than CO2. Dieselgate was sparked by the discovery of real-world NOx emissions far above the legal limits.  Continental's modified VW Golf was fitted with RDE (Real Driving Emissions) equipment - a miniaturised emissions testing rig that can be bolted to a car's towbar for accurate measurement of its emissions.  By 2020 the European Union will phase in RDE testing as an extra requirement, above and beyond current emissions-lab tests, and car brands will have to pass RDE tests to get the type approval that shows their products meet the legal requirements to be sold.  The modified Golf is easily able to deliver NOx emissions well below the legal limit in normal conditions. At the end of my test drive at Continental's proving ground in Germany, including stops and starts, the RDE readout screen in the car showed NOx emissions a little above half the European legal limit.  Clean diesels can be made but they won't be cheap. Continental engineers used existing technology - 48V micro-hybrid set-up, electrically heated exhaust catalyst and high-pressure fuel injection to produce a squeaky clean result but extra tech means extra costs."},{"url":"http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/vince-cable-brexit-eu-immigration-theresa-may-overseas-students-damage-a7862541.html","title":"Theresa May's disastrous immigration targets pushed the UK into an uncertain Brexit – things are set to get much worse - The Independent","short_content":"That is why I am such a strong supporter of The Independent’s campaign, Drop the Target – a target which has no remaining credibility.\nThe case of overseas students illustrates the absurdity of the target and the malign consequences of it.\nInstead, the wrongly estimated numbers of net migrants in the form of overseas students inflated the overall numbers and fuelled the immigration panic.\nThe courts have ruled that 48,000 overseas students have wrongly, and illegally, been sent home without completing their courses, in some cases sacrificing a lifetime of earnings and borrowings by a poor family.\nOne of Britain’s most successful export industries – higher education – was, and is, being sacrificed by Theresa May’s Home Office in pursuit of the immigration target.","content":"In much the same way as the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand was the trigger, if not the underlying cause, of the First World War, the adoption by the Conservatives of an unattainable immigration target triggered the demands for tighter control of EU immigration which is leading not merely to Brexit but to extreme forms of exit by leaving the single market.  I don’t know whether the Conservative pledge in 2010 to cut immigration to the tens of thousands was dreamt up in the bath by David Cameron or, more likely, was inserted in their manifesto by some obscure adviser with nobody understanding its significance. Either way there have been serious consequences which were clearly not understood by those in search of a crunchy soundbite to fight an election. The figure seems to have been plucked out of the air with no evidence base and with no realistic prospect of meeting it. The most damaging consequence of choosing a target in this amateurish and arbitrary way, and then hopelessly missing it year after year, has been a deepening public cynicism feeding the narrative that immigration is “out of control”.  Theresa May has built her political career on a dogged determination to cut immigration. Judged by her own standards, she has failed. As Home Secretary she sent out vans decked with posters telling immigrants to “go home”. And as Prime Minister she has refused to give an unqualified guarantee to remain for EU citizens already here, preferring to use them as bargaining chips in her bigger Brexit negotiation. But despite all this posturing, immigration has not gone down. Meanwhile, she has caused real anguish. These are real people, with real lives, who have also contributed much to Britain’s society and economy. That is why I am such a strong supporter of The Independent’s campaign, Drop the Target – a target which has no remaining credibility.

The most obvious groups are workers from outside the EU on Tier 2 visas; dependents and spouses of non-EU migrants; EU migrants exercising their right to live and work in another EU state; refugees and asylum seekers who are admitted under a separate legal regime; British people who are returning from periods overseas as expatriates; British people who emigrate (the fewer who emigrate, the higher net migration is); and overseas students who are not immigrants but are caught in the definition if they stay for over a year.  The case of overseas students illustrates the absurdity of the target and the malign consequences of it. The vast majority of students return home – apart from a few who have special skills and are recruited for post-study work, and some others who illegally overstay. The problem is that we don’t know how many overstay because the Border Agency did not, until recently, count people out as it counts people in. It operates on guesswork and on the basis of an airport survey which is laughably inaccurate and wildly exaggerates the numbers of over-stayers. Liberal Democrats in government sought to institute exit checks but a combination of Treasury cuts, incompetence and lack of backing from the then Home Secretary led to endless delays.  Instead, the wrongly estimated numbers of net migrants in the form of overseas students inflated the overall numbers and fuelled the immigration panic. There was undoubtedly some abuse and some bogus colleges, but on the assumption that enormous numbers of students were here illegally and that universities and colleges were complicit in these scams, the Home Office cracked down on overseas students in general. My Department of Business stopped the more draconian controls but large numbers, especially from India, have been deterred from coming here and go to the USA, Canada and Australia instead, depriving British universities and colleges of income and British firms of access to expensively trained engineers and scientists who are forced to leave after graduation.  The courts have ruled that 48,000 overseas students have wrongly, and illegally, been sent home without completing their courses, in some cases sacrificing a lifetime of earnings and borrowings by a poor family. One of Britain’s most successful export industries – higher education – was, and is, being sacrificed by Theresa May’s Home Office in pursuit of the immigration target.  Tory minister suggests drop in overseas student numbers is down to ‘uncertainty’ with Brexit  The economic damage caused by the preoccupation with an immigration target goes much further than the specifics of overseas students. The economics of immigration is not totally straightforward since the additional economic activity immigrants generate is not necessarily an increase in per-capita income. There are also social pressures on the supply of accommodation. But generally, the immigration of young people who come to work in occupations which face a skill shortage, or labour shortage more generally, adds significantly to national economic welfare. Conversely, a crackdown to meet the target will undermine economic welfare.  A relatively large net inflow of workers is both a consequence and a cause of economic growth. A big cut in net migration as government policy currently demands will inevitably follow the slowdown which Brexit will bring since there will be less demand for overseas labour and more British people emigrating, looking for work. But attempts to curb recruitment overseas to meet the target will, in itself, lead to economic slowdown as production is disrupted.  Of course we should be training more British people to do jobs with scarce skills but this requires a more considered, longer-term, approach than the pursuit of arbitrary, politically driven targets.

But cheaper versions of the hardware currently used in experimental self-driving vehicles may not deliver the quality of data required for driving at highway speeds.  Most driverless cars make use of lidar sensors, which bounce laser beams off nearby objects to create 3-D maps of their surroundings. Lidar can provide better-quality data than radar and is superior to optical cameras because it is unaffected by variations in ambient light. You’ve probably seen the best-known example of a lidar sensor, produced by market leader Velodyne. It looks like a spinning coffee can perched atop cars developed by the likes of Waymo and Uber.  But not all lidar sensors are created equal. Velodyne, for example, has a range of offerings. Its high-end model is an $80,000 behemoth called HDL-64E—this is the one that looks a lot like a coffee can. It spits 64 laser beams, one atop the other. Each beam is separated by an angle of 0.4° (smaller angles between beams equal higher resolution), with a range of 120 meters. At the other end the firm sells the smaller Puck for $8,000. This sensor uses 16 beams of light, each separated by 2.0°, and has a range of 100 meters.  To see what those numbers mean, look at the videos below. It shows raw data from the HDL-64E at the top, and the Puck at the bottom. The expensive sensor’s 64 horizontal lines render the scene in detail, while the image produced by its cheaper sibling makes it harder to spot objects until they’re much closer to the car. While both sensors nominally have a similar range, the lower resolution of the Puck makes it less useful for obstacles until they are much closer to the vehicle.  At 70 miles per hour, spotting an object at, say, 60 meters out provides two seconds to react. But when traveling at that speed, it can take 100 meters to slow to a stop. A useful range of somewhere closer to 200 meters is a better target to shoot for to make autonomous cars truly safe.  That’s where cost comes in. Even an $8,000 sensor would be a huge problem for any automaker looking to build a self-driving car that a normal person could afford. Because of this, many sensor makers are readying new kinds of solid-state lidar devices, which use an array of tiny antennas to steer a laser beam electronically instead of mechanically. These devices promise to be easier to manufacture at scale and cheaper than their mechanical brethren. That would make them a palatable option for car companies, many of which are looking to build autonomous cars for the mass market as soon as 2021.  But some of these new solid-state devices may currently lack the fidelity required for self-driving cars to operate safely and reliably at highway speeds.  The French auto parts maker Valeo, for example, claims to have built what it says is the world’s first laser scanner for cars that’s ready for high-volume production, the SCALA. It features four lines of data with an angular resolution of 0.8°. Automotive News previously reported that Valeo will provide the lidar sensor used in the new Audi A8, though at the time of writing Audi declined to confirm this and Valeo didn’t respond to a request for details. The new A8 is the first production car to feature lidar and can drive itself—but only in heavy traffic at speeds less than 37 miles per hour.  In June, Graeme Smith, chief executive of the Oxford University autonomous driving spinoff Oxbotica, told MIT Technology Review that he thinks a trade-off between data quality and affordability in the lidar sector might affect the rate at which high-speed autonomous vehicles take to the roads. “Low-speed applications may be more affordable more quickly than higher-speed ones,” he explained. “If you want a laser that’s operating over 250 meters, you need a finely calibrated laser. If you’re working in a lower-speed environment and can get by with 15 meters’ range, then you can afford [to use] a much lower-cost sensor.”  Austin Russell, the CEO of lidar startup Luminar, says his company actively chose not to use solid-state hardware in its sensors, because it believes that while mechanically steering a beam is more expensive, it currently provides more finely detailed images that are critical for safe driving. “It doesn't matter how much machine-learning magic you throw at a couple of points [on an object], you can’t know what it is,” he says. “If you only see a target out at 30 meters or so, at freeway speeds that’s a fraction of a second.”  The standard of solid-state devices available for use in vehicles is likely to improve over time, of course. LeddarTech, for instance, is a Canadian firm based in Quebec that specializes in solid-state devices and is producing reference designs that auto parts makers will then use as a model to produce hardware at scale. The firm’s Luc Langlois says that one of its designs, estimated to cost a car company around $75 to produce, will feature either eight or 16 lines and be available in December 2018. A higher-resolution version, with 64 lines and estimated to cost around $100, will follow about a year later.  For its part, Velodyne has promised to build a solid-state lidar device, which John Eggert, director of automotive sales and marketing, says will use 32 laser lines and boast a range of 200 meters—though he won’t elaborate on the resolution provided by the hardware. And Israeli startup Innoviz Technologies claims to be making a $100 unit with a range of 200 meters and an angular resolution of 0.1°. Both firms have promised to put those sensors into production sometime in 2018, though the scale of production and availability remain unknown. Quanergy, a Silicon Valley startup, is building its own $250 solid-state device due to go into production later this year, but at the time of this writing did not respond to multiple requests for detailed specifications.  Oxbotica’s Smith thinks that automakers might just have to wait it out for a cheap sensor that offers the resolution required for high-speed driving. “It will be like camera sensors,” he says. “When we first had camera phones, they were kind of basic cameras.

Besides Tesla, self-driving car developers depend on an expensive piece of technology called LIDAR, a laser-based radar that allows an autonomous vehicle to see the road. There are cheaper options, but the MIT Technology Review explains that these more-affordable solutions won’t deliver the kind of data that’s necessary for self-driving cars to operate at highway speeds.  A new start-up founded by former Tesla engineers called lvl5 is banking on high-definition maps as being a possible way forward. Companies like Velodyne are working to produce a solid-start LIDAR device; another start-up called Quanergy has a solid-state device of its own in development, and it expects it to cost $250.  Advertisement  But, as the MIT story notes, every piece of LIDAR—which stands for Light Detection and Ranging—has its own characteristics. The spinning turret atop a Google-equipped Chrysler Pacifica can be different from what’s on a self-driving Volvo operated by Uber.  Advertisement  Here’s how the MIT story explains it:  Velodyne, for example, has a range of offerings. Its high-end model is an $80,000 behemoth called HDL-64E—this is the one that looks a lot like a coffee can. It spits 64 laser beams, one atop the other. Each beam is separated by an angle of 0.4° (smaller angles between beams equal higher resolution), with a range of 120 meters. At the other end the firm sells the smaller Puck for $8,000. This sensor uses 16 beams of light, each separated by 2.0°, and has a range of 100 meters.  Tacking on an extra several thousand dollars for a sensor makes robotcars particularly cost prohibitive. And early fully autonomous cars will need perform perfectly with the best equipment to ensure AVs can succeed and win over a currently skeptical public.  Advertisement  That’s why solid-state devices are seen as a solution; they’re easier to manufacturer and cheaper. But current options don’t provide the same data that Velodyne’s HDL-64E provides, the MIT story reports.  In June, Graeme Smith, chief executive of the Oxford University autonomous driving spinoff Oxbotica, told MIT Technology Review that he thinks a trade-off between data quality and affordability in the lidar sector might affect the rate at which high-speed autonomous vehicles take to the roads. “Low-speed applications may be more affordable more quickly than higher-speed ones,” he explained. “If you want a laser that’s operating over 250 meters, you need a finely calibrated laser. If you’re working in a lower-speed environment and can get by with 15 meters’ range, then you can afford [to use] a much lower-cost sensor.”  The story notes that some solutions could be rolled out in the near-future, though how widespread they’ll be is unclear: Velodyne’s solid-state device that’s under development boasts 32 laser lines and a claimed range of 200 meters, but MIT said the company wouldn’t provide a resolution for the hardware. An Israeli startup called Innoviz Technologies says it’s making a $100 unit that can see up to 200 meters ahead with an angular resolution of 0.1°. Both hope to have them in production by next year, MIT reports, but as of now, it’s unclear how available they’ll be  Advertisement  The solid-state tech will almost certainly improve over time, but at the speed automakers are working to get AVs on the road, that’s why cost is something to consider. And that’s why it’s not surprising to read the CEO of a LIDAR developer stating what’s obvious: fully-autonomous cars, early on, will be costly—perhaps as much as $400,000. Until the cheaper solutions succeed in delivering the necessary high-quality data, that’s going to be the reality."},{"url":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/jul/27/aberdeen-brexit-worst-british-centre-for-citieis","title":"Aberdeen to be worst hit by Brexit but all British cities will suffer – report - The Guardian","short_content":"The impacts would be greater in the case of a “hard” Brexit – where the UK would default to trading with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules.\nAll British cities were “set to be negatively affected”, researchers predicted, with GVA on average 1.2% lower under soft Brexit and 2.3% lower under hard Brexit than if the UK remained in the EU.\nCrawley, the town predicted to be least affected by hard Brexit with a decrease in GVA of just 1.1% (and 0.7% under soft Brexit), was an outlier in the same regard as Aberdeen due to its reliance on the air services industry.\nRead moreLess affluent cities could struggle to respond to the economic shocks of Brexit, despite being less directly impacted in the short term.\nAndrew Carter, the chief executive of Centre for Cities, said the impact of either a hard or soft Brexit would be felt very differently across the country.","content":"Analysis from the Centre for Cities thinktank finds urban areas are likely be hit hardest by the increased trade barriers under both hard and soft Brexits  New research examining for the first time the potential impact of Brexit on cities and towns has found Aberdeen could be the hardest hit by higher trade costs with the European Union, though no British city will escape its effects.  The analysis by the Centre for Cities thinktank predicted that in the decade following the implementation of new trade agreements with the EU, every local authority area would be negatively affected.  The impacts would be greater in the case of a “hard” Brexit – where the UK would default to trading with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules.  A “soft” Brexit – if the UK joined a free-trade area with the EU – would lessen its negative effects across the board, especially in London, where economic output as measured by Gross Value Added (GVA) was predicted to decline by 1.3%, compared with 2.6% under a hard Brexit.  All British cities were “set to be negatively affected”, researchers predicted, with GVA on average 1.2% lower under soft Brexit and 2.3% lower under hard Brexit than if the UK remained in the EU. (Belfast in Northern Ireland was excluded due to a lack of available data.)  Aberdeen emerged as the city likely to be most affected in either scenario due to the impact of increasing costs on its oil sector, with a 3.7% forecast decrease in GVA in the case of a hard Brexit, and 2.1% in a “soft” scenario.  Worthing, Reading, Swindon and Slough were predicted to incur a 2.8% loss in the event of hard Brexit, followed by Edinburgh (-2.7%) and London, Aldershot, Leeds and Ipswich (-2.6%).    Generally, cities and towns with high levels of employment in private sector, knowledge-intensive services – such as Reading, London and Edinburgh, the three cities with the largest business and financial sectors – were likely to be most negatively affected by Britain leaving the EU.  Researchers also found a correlation, albeit not a strong one, between areas that voted Remain in last year’s referendum and those that were predicted to be most badly hit.  Crawley, the town predicted to be least affected by hard Brexit with a decrease in GVA of just 1.1% (and 0.7% under soft Brexit), was an outlier in the same regard as Aberdeen due to its reliance on the air services industry.    But the paper’s co-authors, Naomi Clayton and Prof Henry G Overman, warned against placing strong weight on the estimated effects on any particular sector when their analysis was likely underestimating Brexit’s total impact.    Their model did not take into account any effects on cities’ economies other than increasing trade costs – such as the impact on foreign investment and migration – nor how individual cities might adjust to them. At an national those additional factors took the costs of Brexit from a loss of 6.3% of national income to 9.5%.  Researchers warned that Brexit’s impacts would likely be felt differently over time, with the most-affected cities, predominantly in the South of England, also best-placed to adapt to the changes ahead due to their highly skilled workforces and relative wealth.  Can post-Brexit London survive as Europe's cultural and financial capital? Read more  Less affluent cities could struggle to respond to the economic shocks of Brexit, despite being less directly impacted in the short term.  The difference in urban areas’ ability to adapt could exacerbate existing inequality, researchers found, drawing parallels with the 2008 financial crisis, in which London and south-east England were hit hardest but recovered more strongly than other areas.  Andrew Carter, the chief executive of Centre for Cities, said the impact of either a hard or soft Brexit would be felt very differently across the country.  “Contrary to much of the received wisdom on Brexit, it is the most prosperous UK cities which will be hit hardest by the downturn ahead – but poorer places across the north and Midlands will find it tougher to adapt.”  He called on the government to strive to minimise the effect of the coming economic shocks by securing a trade deal with the EU that came as close to maintaining Britain’s current relationship with Europe as possible.  “But it’s also critical that the government uses its forthcoming industrial strategy to give cities across the country the investment, powers and responsibilities they need to make their economies as successful and competitive as possible.”  Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter and Facebook to join the discussion, and explore our archive  "},{"url":"http://www.globalmeatnews.com/Industry-Markets/EU-and-Japan-FTA-to-boost-beef-and-pork-sales","title":"EU and Japan FTA to boost beef and pork sales - Global Meat News - GlobalMeatNews.com","short_content":"An agreement in principle has been reached on the main elements of a free trade agreement (FTA) between the EU and Japan today (6 July).\nAnd Japan will allow duty-free shipments of processed pork and an almost duty-free tariff trade for fresh meat.\nThe European meat industry reacted to the news with jubilation.\n“It is good news for EU producers that this ambitious trade deal has been wrapped up.\nJapanese consumers like high-quality European meat products.”","content":"The EU and Japan have reached what the bloc is calling its “most important bilateral agreement ever”, with the main principles of a free trade deal that will enhance meat exports essentially done.  An agreement in principle has been reached on the main elements of a free trade agreement (FTA) between the EU and Japan today (6 July).  The deal will allow the EU to increase its beef exports to Japan substantially. And Japan will allow duty-free shipments of processed pork and an almost duty-free tariff trade for fresh meat.  The wide-ranging free trade deal will remove the vast majority of taxes paid by EU companies importing goods and services to Japan, one of the world’s largest economies.  A message before the G20 summit  European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker praised the deal for promoting liberal economic values. “Together, we are sending a strong message to the world that we stand for open and fair trade,” Juncker said. “As far as we are concerned, there is no protection in protectionism. Only by working together will we be able to set ambitious global standards. This will be the message that the EU and Japan will bring together to the G20 tomorrow.”  Agriculture commissioner Phil Hogan, praised by Danish Crown for putting the interests of the meat industry first, said: “This is a win-win for both partners, but a big win for rural Europe. The EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement is the most significant and far-reaching agreement ever concluded in agriculture.  “Today, we are setting a new benchmark in trade in agriculture. The Austrian Tiroler Speck, the German Münchener Bier, the Belgian Jambon d’Ardenne, the Polska Wódka as well as over 200 other EU Geographical Indications will now enjoy the same level of protection in Japan that they have in Europe.”  Meat industry ‘quite pleased’  Commissioner for Trade Cecilia Malmström said the deal held “enormous economic importance”.  Both parties will now continue to resolve all the remaining technical issues and hope to produce a final text for the FTA by the end of the year.  The European meat industry reacted to the news with jubilation.  Jean-Luc Mériaux, secretary general of the European Livestock and Meat Trading Union (UECBV) told this site: “The EU meat industry is quite pleased with the agreement in principle between EU and Japan, on the basis of the preliminary outcomes for beef and pork.”  “First of all, the agreement will help to level the playing field with other competitors and countries that already have preferential arrangements with Japan, such as Australia, Chile.  “Then, the deal will mean not only a comprehensive reduction of import tariffs, but also of non-tariff barriers to trade, such as SPS [sanitary and phytosanitary] barriers. Already, EU beef has enjoyed a meaningful translation of SPS barriers elimination into enhanced market access and trade conditions. Hopefully, this trend will continue.  “Finally, further to the positive EU trade diplomacy efforts in Asia, this agreement will complete the picture of successfully negotiated trade agreements in the region, such as EU-South Korea, and forthcoming ones with Singapore and Vietnam. It means the EU meat sector will be able to grasp the trade opportunities of that dynamic and growing region.”  Danish Crown praise Hogan  The CEO of pork giant Danish Crown – which has been eyeing increased exports to Japan for over a year – was also pleased with the deal.  “This agreement is positive for Danish Crown in every way,” said Jais Valeur, Group CEO of Danish Crown.  “We see a potential to increase exports. We believe it may lead to better prices for our products to the benefit of our Danish farmers and, over time, it is my clear hope that we may be able to create 100 to 300 new jobs in Denmark.  “I would therefore like to praise officials in Denmark and the EU – and not least the European commissioner for agriculture Paul Hogan – who have spent thousands of hours on securing the deal. They have given Danish Crown fantastic opportunities for increasing its exports to Japan. Now it is up to us to exploit them.”  European meat processors praise opportunity for premium protein  EU farming body Copa-Cogeca president Martin Merrild said the trade deal struck with Japan will be a big boost to agriculture, particularlly the meat and dairy sectors.  “It is good news for EU producers that this ambitious trade deal has been wrapped up. We believe that opening the Japanese market will benefit in particular the European meat and dairy products sectors, as well as wine and high value added processed products. We also believe that it will have a positive impact on both economies as we share the same goal of wanting to ensure a sustainable agriculture sector with high quality, safe food as well as having family farms.”  A spokesperson for the European Association for the Meat Processing Industry (Clitrav), said: “[We] warmly welcome the agreement reached in principle on the EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement, the most important bilateral trade agreement ever concluded by the EU.  \"One of the key points in that agreement is the increased market access for European meat products on the Japanese market inclduing a duty-free trade tariffs in meat products.

I am concerned about the tone and misinformation that Tom Fletcher presented in his July 17 column.  It is ludicrous to suggest that those in support of increasing BC’s carbon tax think it will put out forest fires. The purpose of a steadily rising price on carbon pollution is to make carbon-intensive goods more expensive than alternatives and to spur innovation.  Carbon taxes don’t need to grow government coffers — for example, with carbon fee and dividend the revenue is returned to households as a dividend to help offset the rising costs.  Addressing climate change is a long-term project – one that will likely continue for all our lives. Increasing BC’s carbon tax is one way to do our fair share to rapidly reduce carbon pollution worldwide so that hopefully we can avoid the most devastating impacts of climate change.  As our climate warms, the risk of devastating forest fires keeps increasing because higher temperatures and prolonged summer droughts dry out our forests. Governments are working hard to find measures to prevent and manage these long and intense fire seasons.  Besides increased forest fires, climate change brings more extreme weather events causing more floods and landslides – like we had across the province this spring.  Sadly, climate change is real and happening now. The well reputed National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency (NOAA) just announced that this year’s global temperature for January to June was the second warmest on record, surprising many scientists because this is not an El Niño year, like last year, when global temperatures tend to be higher.  The current fire situation is of grave concern to many of us here in British Columbia. It will continue to get worse as years go by if we keep polarizing the issue instead of addressing its root cause – our carbon pollution.  My heart goes out to the thousands of fellow British Columbians impacted by these fires and to the firefighters who work tirelessly to save our homes.

Nineteen members of the G20 signed on, with the United States declining. Several Canadian provinces have implemented climate change action plans containing several key components: subsidies to renewable power; household, business and vehicle efficiency programs; and, of course, a carbon pricing program. More recently, after adopting the Paris climate commitment, Ottawa announced it would establish a “backstop” price for greenhouse gas emissions starting at $10 per tonne in 2018, rising to $50 per tonne in 2022. Provinces that don’t adopt equivalent provincial policies will have that new federal tax imposed on them. However, a recent poll by the Angus Reid Institute suggests that the more people learn about carbon pricing the less enamoured they are of such schemes, particularly at the federal level. According to the poll, at least half the population (outside Quebec) oppose the federal tax plan, and a large swath of the public in Alberta (68 per cent) and Saskatchewan (71 per cent) want their leaders to oppose the federal plan. And 55 per cent of Canadians don’t think Canada should move forward with its carbon-pricing plan if it could impact Canadian competitiveness. Canadians are right to be skeptical. As the Fraser Institute showed in a recent study, provinces are implementing carbon pricing in ways that fundamentally violate the three key principles of efficient and economically benign carbon pricing, which are: 1) the tax must displace existing regulations, not be atop them; 2) The tax must be fully rebated to the public as reductions in other distortionary taxes such as income and corporate taxes; and 3) the tax revenues must not be used to distort energy systems by supporting one form of production over another. No province in Canada (including British Columbia) meets all three of these principles. Most don’t meet any. Consider Ontario’s cap-and-trade system instituted by Premier Kathleen Wynne, which her government estimated would bring in $2 billion in revenue per year. According to the Ontario auditor general, out of the $8 billion to be collected in four years, $1.32 billion is earmarked to help with residential and business electricity bills. The rest will be spent on the usual governmental preferences: transit, subsidies to renewable energy and dubious efficiency programs. Alberta’s new carbon tax of $30 per tonne is expected to generate almost $5.4 billion from 2017 to 2020. Part of that (28 per cent) will be given to low- and middle-income Albertans, ostensibly to ease the pain of higher power bills, and the indirect impact of driving up costs of other goods and services in Alberta. The rest will be spent on government pet projects. And then there’s Quebec, which has a cap-and-trade system that has brought in $330 million as of 2016, but is expected to bring in $2.5 billion by 2020 (and perhaps more, if Quebec matches the escalating national price floor established by Ottawa). Where does the revenue go? Free permits are given to emitters while the remaining revenue will be spent on “programs to fight climate change.” Ok, but what about B.C.? Another study by the Fraser Institute verified that in the B.C. carbon tax’s early years, it was truly revenue neutral. Personal and corporate taxes were reduced and additional tax reductions were introduced to ensure revenue neutrality. But by 2014/2015, only five years into the tax system, the government had taken to shaky bookkeeping to preserve the appearance, but not the reality, of revenue neutrality. And from year two of the tax, various tax credits diverted revenues away from general-public tax relief. As for replacing regulations and not tinkering with the energy economy, not only have provinces with climate action plans and carbon pricing failed to do so, they’ve actually increased both regulation and tinkering with their energy systems. Prime Minister Trudeau may have doubled down on his Paris pledge, and postured as the anti-Trumpian climate warrior at the G20. But there’s growing evidence that Canadians don’t like carbon taxes and are realizing they’re not the “efficient” and “economically benign” eco-tax sold by politicians. Instead, carbon taxes are quickly turned into funding mechanisms for expanded government meddling in Canada’s energy economy.

Bipartisanship can happen if senators really want to find solutions. We saw that a few days ago as I held a press conference reintroducing my bill to extend and expand a key tax credit promoting a future for coal while also reducing its carbon emissions.  With me were Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), one of the most vocal advocates on climate change, and Sens. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) and John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) — who, like me, are some of the most vocal advocates for coal. We were standing together introducing this bill because we want to offer a real solution.  To do that, my bill encourages companies to invest in technologies to reduce the amount of CO2 coal-fired power produces, or to harness that carbon for use in enhanced oil recovery. Tax incentives like the ones in our bill helped wind and solar take off.  For folks like me who represent coal states, the motivation is securing a path forward for coal—an abundant, reliable North Dakota resource that provides 80 percent of our state's power. But coal will continue facing challenges if we don't invest in technologies to lower emissions and keep coal competitive, as my bill would do.  For folks like Sen. Whitehouse, the motivation is to reduce emissions here and around the world. And everyone sees a huge economic benefit in developing new ways to use carbon, and exporting that technology to other countries. But whichever way you slice it, our motivations all lead to a single goal: passing a bill that coal companies and environmentalists agree is the most viable path forward on coal and natural gas.  My bill would extend and strengthen the 45Q tax credit, which encourages investment in tools that lower emissions to make sure coal remains a viable, reliable energy source.  Currently, companies receive a $20 per ton tax credit for capturing and storing CO2 and $10 per ton for reusing CO2 in enhanced oil recovery or other uses. That hasn't been enough of an incentive for innovation and implementation—but by bumping up the credits to $50 and $35 per ton respectively, we can spur the level of innovation wind and solar have benefited from.  Getting this bill across the finish line would be a win for North Dakota, which is why I'm pushing to get it done this year.

But Cap & Trade is a flawed system that foists additional needless burdens on businesses, that doesn’t make sense and doesn’t solve the problem.  Democrats have a two-thirds majority in each house of the Legislature and can pass any legislation they want – if they can agree on who gets what. When food fights break out, as has happened with AB 398, the special interests shepherding the bill through the legislature make overtures to the Republicans.

Republican legislators who try to justify their support for cap and trade only demonstrate their irrelevance. As Republicans, our goal is not to cooperate with the Democrat leadership’s war on the middle class but instead to counter it, because our ideas about growth, jobs and family budget issues are better than their ideas.  Cap-and-trade is a hidden tax that consumers pay in price increases on a whole variety of products. Any legislator that doesn’t get that fact is placing more value on their relationship with special interests than on the people they were elected to represent.  Higher prices for energy mean fewer jobs. Small businesses ask why they should stay in a high-cost state like California when there are small business-friendly states that would welcome them.  Every time the liberal elite passes a tax, a fee or a regulation that raises consumer prices, people lose their jobs. Real people. Real jobs lost. I don’t want to cooperate with the politicians that are doing that, I want to replace them before even one more small business is forced to close its doors.  Apart from standing on firm Republican principled ground, I believe that the majority of regular Californians, including Democrats and Independents, want our party to stand up boldly as fiscal watchdogs. That’s our role. As the late esteemed columnist Robert Novak once said, “God made Republicans to oppose taxes”. There’s more than a grain of truth to that. After all, if Republicans won’t stand up for taxpayers and working families, who will?  John Cox is a San Diego businessman running for governor of California.

U.S. crude shipments abroad are on the rise. A spike in gasoline prices predicted by critics of lifting the ban hasn't materialized. And utilities are adding wind and solar to the grid at breakneck speed.  But if the legislation's impact on energy markets is clear, its implications for climate change are less so. While wind and solar have helped green America's grid, U.S. oil production is projected to reach record levels in 2018. American refineries are also sending ever-larger shipments of petroleum coke abroad. Petcoke, as the carbon material is commonly known, is a byproduct of heavy crudes refined in the United States. It is frequently blended with coal used in electricity generation.  \"Our refineries are creating more CO2 in the developing world, but they are the ones who have to account for it,\" said Deborah Gordon, director of the energy and climate program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"You can clap your hands and say bravo to the U.S. power sector, but it doesn't mean we can say this offsets that — even in our country.\"  The export ban and tax incentives, included as part of a 2015 spending package, represented a rare intersection of conservative and liberal priorities in Congress. Republicans overcame concerns about the impact of subsidies for wind and solar to lift a ban on crude exports they viewed as badly outdated. Democrats set aside worries over the climate impact of crude exports to solidify tax incentives for wind and solar. The largest disagreement at the time was whether lifting the ban would increase gasoline prices.  Advertisement  The bill has largely had the intended effect. U.S. crude shipments abroad totaled roughly 1 million barrels a day in April, up from almost 400,000 at the end of 2015. (The ban did not apply to Canada.) The growing export market has offered a bright spot for oil companies battered by yo-yoing crude prices.  Lifting the ban has also eroded the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' ability to set crude prices, said Phil Flynn, a commodities analyst at the Price Futures Group.  Where major producers like Saudi Arabia once increased production or curtailed it to meet global demand, \"now we look for market forces more to drive that situation,\" he said. \"I think it's a good thing.\"  Power companies, meanwhile, installed more solar than any other fuel source in 2016, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Wind ranked third.  Tax incentives played a large role in both industries' recent building booms. The extension of a 30 percent investment tax credit (ITC) for solar helped prompt a 148 percent increase in utility-scale solar installations, according to industry projections. The wind industry estimates there is 21 gigawatts of wind capacity in development today because of the revival of a production tax credit (PTC) of 2.3 cents per kilowatt-hour.  Both incentives will gradually decline, with the PTC phasing out in 2020 and the ITC falling to 10 percent for commercial- and utility-scale projects after 2021.  \"The PTC and ITC have significantly changed the course of history for the utility industry, and play a large role in the transition to clean energy nationwide,\" said Xcel Energy Inc. CEO Ben Fowke.  The Minnesota-based utility was already adding wind prior to the extension of the PTC. But the addition of the tax incentives has seen Xcel quicken its pace. By 2021, the company expects wind will account for more of its power generation than any other fuel in Xcel's eight-state service territory.  Lazard, a financial advisory and asset management firm, reckons the incentives have helped the wind and solar industries scale, driving down costs and making them competitive without subsidies in most markets today. That is why the bank thinks the incentives for wind and solar are unlikely to be extended when they expire.  \"You're seeing renewables displace baseload generation, and that's coal and nuclear generation,\" said Georges Arbache, director of Lazard's power energy and infrastructure team. \"That's increasingly based solely on market economics.\"  Exporting U.S. petcoke — and emissions  In Washington, the measure's success has offered its sponsors a rare opportunity to tout a bipartisan achievement. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican who helped broker the compromise, said she felt a \"little bit redeemed\" after seeing the legislation's impact on global oil markets.  \"We've seen the United States playing a very stabilizing role with regards to not only the production, but the price,\" she said.  The law's success might be even more valuable to Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, a North Dakota Democrat who pushed the compromise and faces a tough re-election campaign in 2018. Heitkamp, in an interview, heralded the measure's benefits to North Dakota's sizable oil and wind industries.  As U.S. production surged, a price gap opened between the price of West Texas Intermediate, the American crude benchmark, and Brent, its European counterpart.  \"We believed that was a result of that commodity locked in with no opportunity for exports,\" Heitkamp said.  The price differential between the two has narrowed since the ban was lifted and more pipelines have come online to ferry oil to domestic markets.  As for the wind industry, Heitkamp said, the biggest concern she hears from executives at General Electric Co.'s turbine manufacturing plant in Grand Forks, N.D., is whether they can produce enough blades to keep up with demand.  \"This was a huge economic win-win for North Dakota energy,\" she said.  It is less clear if the law is a win for the climate, however.  A 2016 study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory estimated that tax incentives for wind and solar could result in emissions reductions ranging from 540 million metric tons to 1,400 million metric tons of carbon between 2016 and 2030. But whether that is enough to offset emissions from other sectors of the economy is unclear. EIA estimates U.S. oil production will hit 9.9 million barrels a day in 2018, a record.  Rising petcoke exports also threaten the gains in the U.S. power sector, an unintended consequence of lifting the ban, said Gordon. In around 2010, U.S. refineries overhauled their facilities to process heavy crudes from Canada's oil sands and the Gulf of Mexico. The advent of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing unleashed a torrent of light, sweet crude from America's shale plays. The result: The United States is a country that produces light, sweet crudes but imports heavier varieties to its refineries.  That in turn has helped spur the increase in American petcoke exports. U.S. exports of petcoke jumped 7 percent in 2016, rising from 196 million barrels to 210 million barrels, according to EIA figures. India was the top market for U.S. exports, followed by Japan, Turkey and Mexico. Petcoke today is one of the United States' leading petroleum exports, behind diesel and liquefied petroleum gas like propane, and nearly equal with gasoline.  \"We haven't solved the problems of how to address leakage. We make these policies, and they sometimes promote leakage,\" Gordon said, referring to carbon emissions. \"We could have better realized the better economic benefits and the environmental trade-offs rather than just reacting and letting it happen.\""},{"url":"https://thewire.in/162115/rcep-talks-questions-loom-large-over-india/","title":"As Current Rounds of Talks Draw to a Close, Questions About RCEP Loom Large Over India - The Wire","short_content":"The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), the new mega free trade agreement (FTA) on the horizon, is looming large.\nAs the RCEP goes through its 19th round of negotiations in Hyderabad from July 24- 28, questions and concerns for India are intensifying.\nIndia has to be ready to give up a lot in its goods producing sectors, in both agriculture and industry.\nThe RCEP asks for stronger protection provisions for its investors than in some of India’s current investment treaties.\nIndia has presented this as its proposal in the RCEP, but other countries do not seem to be interested.","content":"Share this:  Tweet  WhatsApp  Print  More  Email        Pocket      With the RCEP asking for stronger protection for its investors, India is reviewing and trying to replace its investment treaties with a new model.  The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), the new mega free trade agreement (FTA) on the horizon, is looming large. Being negotiated between the ten-member ASEAN bloc and Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, China and India, the mega FTA is seen as the small (but steadily growing) brother of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) that cost the Democrats, at least partially, the US election.  As the RCEP goes through its 19th round of negotiations in Hyderabad from July 24- 28, questions and concerns for India are intensifying. India has always been a hesitant player in this mega FTA, reluctant to commit to the ambitious standards set by its partners, be it in goods (both agricultural and industrial), intellectual property rights, investment, e-commerce or other areas. But India’s offensive interest lies in services, most notably in Mode 4 or movement of Indian professionals to the other RCEP countries. And however unrealistic this is under the current global environment, it makes India keen not to abandon the game and doggedly fight on.  However, if anything on paper has to materialise in services, even if unrealisable in reality, the cost won’t be small. India has to be ready to give up a lot in its goods producing sectors, in both agriculture and industry. In addition, it may have to concede policy space in areas such as intellectual property rights, e-commerce and investment. These areas are sensitive from a policy perspective for all developing countries and represent significant challenges to regulatory space.  India has already been grappling with its investment agreements and is facing 20 investor treaty cases where a large cross section of its policymaking is being held ransom by foreign companies investing in India. The RCEP asks for stronger protection provisions for its investors than in some of India’s current investment treaties. As an interesting juxtapose, India is now reviewing and trying to replace its investment treaties and with a new model text, which, while not perfect, contains much more safeguards. India has presented this as its proposal in the RCEP, but other countries do not seem to be interested. It seems the infamous investor-state dispute settlement clause that allows foreign investors to sue governments in international tribunals may have been already accepted.  E-commerce, on the other hand, is a relatively unknown area with complex dynamics. Unconfirmed reports say the earlier stance of “no binding rules” seem to be gravitating towards a binding regime in the RCEP. Multiple proposals in this chapter suggest e-commerce in the RCEP is not only about the trade of rapidly growing and hugely profitable digitised and digitisable (with almost infinite potential) goods and services, it is about the control of future policymaking across a number of sectors including industrial policy, financial policy, labour policy and so on. The control of big data is key to the future economic policymaking and profit generation, and the big corporations developing and profiting from e-technology want to ensure “new rules” in e-commerce that guarantee there are no rules for them even in the future. Moreover, India has said no to e-commerce negotiations at the WTO and any difference in its stance at the RCEP is likely to have repercussions.  In fact, in a surprising turn of events, even government procurement (GP) seems to be on the table. India has always rejected demands for opening up this arena, which involves government purchase contracts in goods and services. India, like most developing countries, uses this for development purposes; to develop domestic industry especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), to give preferences to weaker suppliers such as women’s self-help groups, and khadi and village enterprises. In fact, the EU’s repeated demands for opening up GP was a key block in the EU-India FTA negotiations. In the earlier rounds, GP did not seem to be on the cards, but in recent times, talks on GP seems to be on the menu. Even transparency and cooperation in GP can bring more compliance burden and will discriminate against domestic suppliers as these provisions will relate only to foreign companies.  But let us come back to the question of agriculture and industry. While costs to policy space from the above chapters are likely to be enormous, the goods chapter that deals with the primary and traditional instrument of “trade”, i.e., import duty reduction, still holds immense importance for India. That is because both agriculture and to a lesser extent, industry, in India are still protected by tariffs or import duties. While clamour for elimination of duties grows worldwide, it is undeniable that the developed countries used high tariffs to protect their economies and producers at different stages of development; US used 50% import duty while industrialising while the EU countries used 18-30%. But in today’s world, they are asking the followers to do it differently.  India currently faces a demand to eliminate duties on 92% of its products and perhaps keep very low duties on another 7%, covering a total of 99% of all its agricultural and industrial products. What will be the implication of duty elimination in the RCEP on India?  In agriculture, even with relatively modest coverage (by RCEP norms) in the ASEAN-India FTA, and without full duty elimination on certain plantation products, India is flooded by imports of vegetable oil, notably palm oil and coconut oil, rubber, fruit and nuts, cocoa, coffee, vanilla, cinnamon and cloves. Trade deficit in palm oil stands at over Rs 40 thousand crores and in rubber at Rs 4.8 thousand crores, having devastating impact on farmers and plantations in these sectors.  Moreover, the new partners, Japan, Australia and New Zealand are big players in the agriculture arena. While Japan did not give or ask for tariff access to its agricultural products under the Japan-India FTA (2010), the 99% coverage will now give Japan access to Indian markets. Apart from the ‘sacred five’ products, rice, wheat, dairy, beef, and sugar, Japan’s booming exports are seafood and processed food products. Australia and New Zealand are large exporters of meat and dairy products and are asking for specific access into these markets, as confirmed by the chief negotiator from New Zealand. New Zealand produces five times the dairy it needs.  But apart from the high food standards faced by Indian farmers in these markets, they are also significant subsidisers. Japan is a large subsidiser while Australia and New Zealand much less so, but if we compare per farmer figures, Japan, New Zealand and Australia give US $14136, 2623, and 537 worth of subsidies (WTO notified) per farmer respectively, compared to US $228 per farmer in India. Subsidies, as it turns out, cannot be negotiated under an FTA.  Detailed analysis is clearly required in the industry. The Indian industry is up in arms against this FTA and not without reason. India’s total trade deficit with China stands at Rs 342.706 thousand crores, half of the total Indian trade deficit and this, without an existing FTA. Trade deficit with ASEAN stands at a growing Rs 64.147 thousand crores and with Japan at Rs 34.059 thousand crores. Given an industry that is still grappling to find its feet, this FTA could represent a major threat to SMEs, industrial promotion and job creation.  But the most worrying trend remains that of secrecy and non-transparency in the process. The FTA negotiations are more secret than Trump’s interactions with Russia for sure. Texts are not shared with affected stakeholders, and the state government and the parliament’s role remains cosmetic. No ratification by the parliament is needed in India and even impact assessment studies are not in public domain. The country at large, it seems, is bypassed in the FTA; and the RCEP negotiations, in particular, have been one of most closely guarded secrets in the history of India’s trade policymaking.

Serena minivan equipped with the automaker's ProPilot autonomous-drive technology during a test drive at the Oppama Grandrive proving ground in Yokosuka, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan, on Tuesday, July 12, 2016. Kiyoshi Ota/Bloomberg via Getty Images  When Google launched its self-driving cars project seven years ago, many saw it as an inconceivable moonshot. Today that idea fuels a global arms race for technology and talent, with even the Queen of England anteing up to get the biggest piece of the reported $7 trillion pie .  While tech superpowers Uber, Google, Tesla, and Lyft dominate the news cycles, traditional car manufacturers are running expensive Silicon Valley research centers, expanding self-driving fleets , forging partnerships, and plowing billions into acquisitions . Name a major player in either the tech or transportation ecosystem, and they’re probably investing in autonomous, self-driving, technology.  This is all for good reason: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are our future. While significant technical challenges remain unsolved, AV technology is improving rapidly. Soon technological capability won’t be the greatest impediment to adoption; societal friction will be. This friction will delay full autonomy for at least a decade, or however long it takes for the tech community ( which hasn’t always been particularly empathetic ) to collaborate with policymakers, regulators, insurance providers, and consumer advocates to address the significant social, regulatory, and legal challenges AVs will create.  Autonomous vehicles can dramatically reduce vehicular injuries and deaths, but we don’t yet know how people will react to the inevitable mistakes that will occur. Tesla’s self-driving technology was at first blamed and then cleared for a fatal crash in Ohio , but Uber’s self-driving cars missed at least six red lights in San Francisco last year. Even though society accepts car accidents as an unavoidable (and horrible) risk associated with mobility, machine error will be judged much more harshly than human error due to the expectation of precision.  With artificial intelligence (AI) playing an increasing role in AV technology , self-driving vehicles will inevitably make “wrong” choices when presented with options of who will live and who will die. Many companies and institutions are tackling the ethical side of decisions made by self-driving cars, such as MIT’s Moral Machine (a judgment crowdsourcing platform) and Crowdflower ’s approach to machine learning with human-in-the-loop AI . Over time, more segments of society will need to contribute to these morally and legally challenging decisions.  AVs will save lives, but their adoption could result in massive job loss. By some estimates, there are four million taxi, delivery, bus, and truck drivers in the U.S.—all of whose jobs could be automated. And that doesn’t even take into account the management and support staff for those jobs, nor the trickle-down impact on the gas stations, motels, retail outlets, and restaurants that rely on trucking routes.  AVs can’t vote; workers can. Policy makers will need to have serious political will to prioritize saving lives and future technology over real and perceived job loss, especially if the economic headwinds continue to blow in a populist direction. We’re yet to find out the details of the Trump administration’s commitment to updating the existing Obama-era self-driving guidelines in the coming months.  Another risk accompanies the emergence of AVs. Remember the Wired journalist who allowed hackers to take over his car—with him in it ? That hack was carried out with only a few components of the car controlled by a computer. AVs, by contrast, are run entirely by software. An alert driver could override the self-drive function if they realized something was going wrong, but if no one’s at the wheel, there’s no human safety backup. While we haven’t seen any large-scale automotive hacks yet, we did see a preview of the security risks inherent to Internet-connected automobiles with last year’s high-profile hack into household Internet of Things (IoT) devices . To manage the risk of a more destructive hack that could weaponize automated vehicles, significant advances in cybersecurity will be required, along with commitment from the entire connected automotive ecosystem to adopt state-of-the-art security technology.  The path to level 5 autonomy, or a completely autonomous vehicle that performs equally to a human, will be incremental and evolutionary, with drivers and autonomy coexisting for a long period while technology, regulations, infrastructure, and public opinions sort out the moral and ecosystem issues. AVs are inevitable, but fortunately for consumers, the technologies required for ubiquity will improve the safety, efficiency, and enjoyment of the ride along the way—whether there’s a person, a machine or a combination of the two in the driver’s seat.

I am old enough to remember the first energy crisis during the Carter Administration when long lines of cars waited their turn to get gasoline at gas stations. The gasoline pumps had to be refitted with new gages because gasoline prices had for the first time reached more than a dollar a gallon.  We thought it was the end of the world. It certainly was a disaster for Jimmy Carter and his fellow Democrats.  People were also mad at big oil companies and OPEC. Lots of ideas were floated (mostly bad) to deal with the crisis, everything from rationing to taxing oil imports. Most economists tried to explain to politicians and the public that taxing oil (all oil, not just imports) was the best way to reduce oil consumption.  The logic is simple. When prices go up, consumers respond rationally and buy more efficient cars and drive less. They also turn down their thermostats in winter and turn them up in the summer. Likewise, businesses look for ways to cut oil consumption and are more willing to invest in energy saving equipment or move to alternate fuels.    Give a subscription to our award-winning newspaper and save $10.  No one listened. For politicians, the idea of raising taxes on oil at a time oil and gasoline prices were rising was political suicide. The public would not stand for it. In addition, domestic oil producers were also making billions of dollars because of the price rise, and their campaign contributions were important to both parties. No Texas representative, not even a liberal Democrat, was going to support taxing oil.  As a result, Democrats turned to government regulations, especially on the auto industry, to encourage conservation. They also supported government subsidies to encourage conservation and alternative energy sources.  Republicans argued that these were not needed. The market would move consumers and companies to do the right thing; regulations were not needed.  In truth, higher gasoline prices did move Americans into smaller cars. The problem was that when prices went down, Americans started buying gas guzzlers again.  The rise and fall of gasoline prices drove the auto industry into near bankruptcy because it always seemed to have a backlog of the wrong kind of cars when prices changed. Retooling factories to respond to American consumers' changing preferences proved time consuming and expensive.  Instability is bad for business. The auto industry, and most other companies, would prefer higher oil taxes rather than government-mandated energy-efficiency standards.  Today, we are not just dealing with an oil crisis but with climate change, which is caused by the release of carbon into the atmosphere by all fossil fuels. The response from most economists is the same: Put a tax on carbon and the market will encourage consumers and businesses to use less and become more efficient.  Such a tax is much simpler than cap-and-trade proposals, which would set limits on carbon emissions and then allow those who are under their limits sell their \"credits\" to others.  Politically, putting a tax on carbon is going to be difficult. The coal industry will portray such a tax as kicking them while they are down. Domestic oil and gas producers will fight it. Consumers will not like the higher prices that will come with a carbon tax. And Republicans hate all taxes.  Are there ways to make a carbon tax more politically palatable?  First, a carbon tax has to be introduced gradually. For example, if it had the effect of raising gasoline taxes by one cent a month, consumers would not experience it as a shock, yet after 10 years, it would amount of $1.20 per gallon.  The predictability of this increase would also encourage consumers to buy fuel efficient cars and products because they know that fuel prices are going to continue to rise. Industry would also invest in more efficient equipment. Investors could put their money into alternative sources of energy with the sure knowledge that demand would continue to rise and their investment would not be endangered by a sudden drop in oil and gas prices.  Second, a carbon tax could raise a lot of money. Environmentalist would like to see that invested in programs to protect the environment, including public transportation and making public facilities more energy efficient. But any politically successful proposal will need to have plenty of money for red states if the plan is going to get any Republican support.  An alternative is to return most of the money to American citizens through an annual \"carbon dividend\" check to every man, woman and child in America. This responds to liberal concerns that a carbon tax would be regressive, as well as responding to Republican concerns that the money from a carbon tax would increase the size of government.  On the Global Catholic Climate Movement website, Jorge Villarreal argues, \"The rich are super-polluters and carbon taxes should be paired with other policy instruments to redistribute wealth and reinvest in clean energy.\" Direct payments to the poor would reverse any harm done to them by the carbon tax.  Third, corporate America is not supporting a pure carbon tax. In return for a carbon tax, they want less government regulation. Here both sides need to be reasonable. Liberals need to acknowledge that not all regulations are good; some are very burdensome and yet have little impact. On the other hand, a low carbon tax in exchange for the elimination of energy-efficiency regulations would be a bad deal.  For example, the Obama administration tried to get energy companies to reduce the amount of methane gas leaking from oil and gas operations. Methane warms the atmosphere at about 30 times the rate carbon dioxide does. This is not a priority for the Trump EPA. In fact, as attorney general of Oklahoma, Scott Pruitt had a history of fighting oil and gas regulations from the EPA, which he now heads.  Congress is unlikely to legislate perfectly when it comes to a carbon tax, but even with unpalatable compromises it might be worth doing.  In 2015, religious institutional investors in Canada called on their government to tax carbon. American religious groups need to get on board.  A carbon tax would be good for America and good for the planet, but the devil is in the details when it comes to what is also included in any legislation.  [Jesuit Fr.

Particularly when it comes to doing anything about addressing climate change.  On Wednesday, Australia could have had a lively, informed discussion about how efficient our cars should be. Instead we had a confected, useless argument about a new \"carbon tax\" that nobody has proposed.  Thanks to the media and politicians, any normal person would be thoroughly confused about what was going on.  Here's the story.  Last December, the government released three discussion papers examining how to improve fuel quality and vehicle emissions standards. The overriding goal was to help Australia achieve the emissions reduction targets it agreed at the Paris summit by making our cars more efficient and fuel less dirty.  It's a discussion worth having. Unlike countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, India and Canada, there are no minimum fuel efficiency standards for light vehicles in Australia. That makes us a global outlier.  Advertisement  The government asked for feedback from interested parties: car manufacturers, health and environment groups and motorist associations.  On Monday afternoon, the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development emailed stakeholders with a proposed model for a new fuel efficiency standard. Again, feedback from interested parties was welcomed.  SHARE  Share on Facebook SHARE  Share on Twitter TWEET  Link The public has little faith in federal politicians, or the media. Photo: Andrew Meares  Details of the proposed standard - which is tougher than car makers had expected - were soon passed on to journalists, who wrote it up for the next day's papers. And that's where things started going wrong.  The Daily Telegraph splashed on its front page with the story: \"A 'carbon tax' on all new vehicles in Australia - that will push up the cost of our most popular cars by thousands of dollars - is being proposed by the Turnbull government.\"  Except it isn't.  The new fuel efficiency standard would make some cars more expensive and there would be financial penalties for car companies that break the rules.  But that doesn't make it a \"tax\" (in the sense of being a compulsory financial contribution imposed by government to raise revenue). Just as any news story with an error isn't \"fake news\", any measure to reduce carbon emissions isn't necessarily a \"tax\".  But \"carbon tax\" is a catchy phrase, loaded with political baggage, so outlets such as The Australian and Fairfax Media followed The Tele and ran with this angle.  The headlines made life momentarily difficult for Environment Minister Josh Frydenberg but, in another sense, they were a gift.  \"This story is a beat up,\" Frydenberg said.  \"The government has no plans to introduce a carbon tax on the family car - it's about as likely as Elvis coming back.\"  And with that sound bite, TV and radio interviewers quickly moved on, leaving viewers and listeners unclear about what the government plans to do.  Into the factual vacuum stormed Opposition Leader Bill Shorten who declared: \"You have the government putting out a discussion paper proposing a carbon tax on motor vehicles ... What I say today is that Labor has no plans and will not have a carbon tax on motor vehicles.\"  He then said: \"We believe you have to have emissions standards in vehicles. We want greater fuel efficiency.\"  In other words, Labor supports the government's actual policy (vehicle emissions standards) but has ruled out supporting a fictitious policy (a carbon tax on cars).  For politicians and journalists alike it's no wonder, on days such as this, the public professes to have such little faith in what we do.

WASHINGTON — First-of-its-kind legislation governing self-driving vehicles cruised through a House panel last week, but could face a few detours on its way to enactment.  The legislation borrows heavily from the wish lists of automakers and technology companies that want leeway to operate their self-driving test vehicles on public highways without being tied too closely to rules designed for vehicles controlled by humans.  Subcommittee Democrats backed the bill, but say they want to add provisions addressing safety concerns before it's considered by the full Energy and Commerce Committee.  \"This proposal has a long way to go before becoming law and is likely to undergo substantial revision,\" said Mike Overly, an attorney in the automotive practice of Foley & Lardner. \"Moreover, competing or alternate proposals are being considered.\"  A committee spokeswoman said leaders want to vote on the legislation by the end of the month.

Key provisions of the legislation:   Significantly raises the number of vehicles that can be exempted from federal safety standards so that developers can collect more data and refine their artificial intelligence systems. Automakers could each deploy 100,000 vehicles a year for five years without needing to meet existing standards.   Requires manufacturers to certify that vehicles are likely to function as intended and have safety redundancies, but doesn't require them to get federal approval of technologies during development.   Directs the Department of Transportation to issue a rule updating vehicle safety standards and adding new performance standards for highly autonomous vehicles.   Prohibits states from regulating design and performance standards for self-driving vehicles, but frees them to set insurance, license and registration requirements and enforce traffic laws.   Directs automakers to have cybersecurity protections against hackers.   Authorizes the DOT to establish an advisory council on highly automated vehicles."},{"url":"https://www.aei.org/events/carbon-taxes-a-problem-or-a-solution-remarks-from-sen-sheldon-whitehouse-d-ri-and-sen-brian-schatz-d-hi/","title":"Carbon taxes: A problem or a solution?

Sheldon Whitehouse attending a special Washington screening of Al Gore's \"An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power.\" (Photo by Paul Morigi/Getty Images for Paramount Pictures)  President Trump’s ascent to the Oval Office should have hit pause on any legislative effort to curb climate-altering emissions.  Yet chatter about one proposal continunes -- a tax on carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere. In February, a group of Republicans -- led by James A. Baker, who served in both Ronald Reagan’s and George H.W. Bush’s Cabinets -- pitched a version of that emissions-reduction measure to Trump officials.  No new White House policy came out of that meeting. But now a pair of Democratic senators are trying again, reaching across the aisle in their own branch of government to sell a carbon tax as a way to smooth the bumpy road to tax reform.  To make their first pitch to Republicans, the two sponsors of the legislation, Sheldon Whitehouse (R.I.) and Brian Schatz (Hawaii), entered the lion’s den.  “I know how crazy this sounds,” Schatz told a crowd at the American Enterprise Institute, one of the pillars of conservative thought in Washington. “But I want you to know that what is more politically palatable than taxing your groceries to reduce the top corporate income tax rate is taxing carbon pollution.”  The senators insisted there are Republican lawmakers out there who would support the legislation -- between six and 10, Whitehouse said -- even if none of them wished to be the first to do so aloud.  “It has to do with the fossil-fuel industry,” Whitehouse said in an interview after the event. Lobbying groups representing U.S. corporations, like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and American Petroleum Institute, Whitehouse contended, are content with no action being taken on climate change while company executives themselves can continue offering rhetoric.  “That prevents you from being shunned at Davos cocktail parties,” Whitehouse said, adding to clarify “that is what I’ve observed.”  The bill is a conventional carbon tax proposal, though flexed to fit the whims of Trump’s Washington.  A $49-per-metric-ton fee would be placed on carbon emissions, with the estimated $2.1 trillion raised in the first decade going to fund a top GOP wish list item: A reduction of the top marginal corporate income-tax rate, from 35 percent to 29 percent. Revenue raised would also address other Trumpian priorities like paying for veterans’ benefits and granting states money to help workers find new jobs after leaving declining industries -- like coal.  “With a small fraction of the revenue from a carbon fee,” Whitehouse said in his speech, “we can assure every single coal miner a lifetime of comfort and financial stability.”  But Myron Ebell, director of the Center for Energy and Environment at the libertarian Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEE) and head of President Trump’s transition team at the Environmental Protection Agency, called the proposal dead on arrival.  “I’d like to see the anti-oligarchic leftist Democrats like Sen. Whitehouse defend taking money out of the pockets of poor people and putting it in the hands of people who own shares in major U.S. corporations,” Ebell said on the panel after Whitehouse spoke.  “The reason that’s in there,” Ebell said of the corporate tax break, “is that they want to lure some Republicans to front this effort, and that is not going to work because conservatives are the stupid party but not that stupid.”  Myron Ebell during an interview with The Associated Press in January. (AP Photo)  On the surface, Republican opposition to efforts to reduce the emissions of climate-warming gases -- or even to admitting climate change exists -- is slowly chipping away, even under Trump. While failing to find GOP co-sponsors for this bill, Whitehouse along with Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) were able to get two Republicans, Shelley Moore Capito (W.Va.) and John Barrasso (Wyo.), to sign onto a carbon-capture bill earlier this month.  And on the other side of the Capitol, a bipartisan caucus committed to acknowledging and addressing climate change is up to 50 House members from only 18 in January.  “There are quite a number of other Republicans in the wings, waiting to do this,” former vice president Al Gore stated in a March interview. “I know that for a fact.”  But Republicans deeply skeptical of climate science, such as Sen. James M. Inhofe (Okla.), suggest that silent majority within the GOP -- that doesn’t talk publicly much about climate change -- swings his way.  For example, 22 GOP senators sent a letter to Trump in May asking him to pull out of the Paris climate accord. “We could have gotten a lot more signatures,” Inhofe, who helped organize the letter, said in an interview at the time. “There’s no question about that.”  As for the temperature in the AEI auditorium on Wednesday, where representatives from disparate groups like Ebell’s CEE and the Environmental Defense Fund gathered: One of the few lines to draw applause from the eclectic audience was a call to action for conservatives.  “There are so many potential benefits and such a real threat,” Adele Morris of the Brookings Institution said, “that it boggles the mind why people who are conservative are still debating whether there’s a case to be made for action or not.”  POWER PLAYS  Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) being followed by reporters as she arrives to vote on Capitol Hill. (Photo by Oliver Contreras/For The Washington Post)  -- You've got a nice state here, it would be a shame if something happened to it...: The Alaska Dispatch News has a chilling account of a pair of phone calls Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke made to Alaska's two Republican senators, Dan Sullivan and Lisa Murkowski, in which Zinke suggests Murkowski's vote against starting debate on health care (read the latest here) could have lasting consequences in the Last Frontier.  Here's how Sullivan described the \"troubling message\":  I'm not going to go into the details, but I fear that the strong economic growth, pro-energy, pro-mining, pro-jobs and personnel from Alaska who are part of those policies are going to stop... I tried to push back on behalf of all Alaskans… We're facing some difficult times and there's a lot of enthusiasm for the policies that Secretary Zinke and the president have been talking about with regard to our economy. But the message was pretty clear...  A few points:  The conversation is not hearsay, or based on anonymous reporting. Sullivan decided to disseminate the message by talking directly to the Alaska Dispatch News, the most widely read newspaper in the state. Murkowski was not available to comment to the paper, but Sullivan said Zinke also contacted Murkowski.  It's a brazen broadside to make against Murkowski in particular because, as chair of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, she oversees the Department of the Interior and the confirmation process of its top political officials.  At the same time, one of Murkowski's top priorities at the moment is passing a bipartisan energy bill sponsored by her and Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.). Should the health-care effort fail, that bill could be the biggest piece of legislation to land on Trump's desk since taking office.  Trump's feelings about Murkowski, though, is no secret -- even if it surprising that his administration would suggest such retaliation against an entire state for the vote of a senator not even up for reelection until 2022. On Wednesday morning, Trump tweeted:  Senator @lisamurkowski of the Great State of Alaska really let the Republicans, and our country, down yesterday. Too bad! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 26, 2017  Erica Martinson, the Alaska Dispatch News reporter who broke the story, suggested that for Trump that wouldn't be enough:  ? Did you think @realDonaldTrump was going to just let that @lisamurkowski vote go with only a tweet? https://t.co/Fjx2LCBJD5 — Erica Martinson (@EricaMartinson) July 27, 2017  -- More on Zinke: The secretary is scheduled to travel to New Mexico on Thursday as part of his continued review of national monuments, according to local news station KRQE. He will visit the Organ Mountains Desert Peaks National Monument, according to the report, as well the Rio Grande del Norte National Monument. The Las Vegas Review Journal also reported that Zinke will travel to Nevada next week. Two monuments, Gold Butte and Basin and Range, in Nevada designated under President Obama are part of the 22 national monuments and five marine monuments the Trump administration is reviewing.  -- Zinke mistakenly referred to Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin as a “fellow veteran” in a group photo of members of President Trump’s administration:  Energy Secretary Rick Perry, Shulkin and senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway were in the photo as the group headed to Youngstown, Ohio on Air Force One.  Perry is a veteran from the Air Force, the Associated Press reported, but Shulkin, a medical doctor who President Obama appointed as under secretary for health in the Department of Veterans Affairs in 2015, has not served in the military. He is the first head of the department who is not a veteran himself.  Energy Secretary Perry talking with former \"Saturday Night Live\" comedian and radio host Joe Piscopo at the White House. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais)  -- Why the scariest nuclear threat may be coming from inside the Trump administration: Michael Lewis, of \"Moneyball\" and \"The Big Short\" fame, has a compelling if not disturbing look into Trump's Department of Energy — or, as one source put it to Lewis, the part of the government working on \"the two biggest risks to human existence, nuclear weapons and climate change.\"  Great anecdotes abound, like this one about the man in charge of nuclear weapons at the department (emphasis added):  In the run-up to the Trump inauguration the man inside the D.O.E. in charge of the nuclear-weapons program was required to submit his resignation, as were the department’s 137 other political appointees. Frank Klotz was his name, and he was a retired three-star air-force lieutenant general with a PhD in politics from Oxford. The keeper of the nation’s nuclear secrets had boxed up most of his books and memorabilia just like everyone else and was on his way out before anyone had apparently given the first thought to who might replace him. It was only after Secretary Moniz called a few senators to alert them to the disturbing vacancy, and the senators phoned Trump Tower sounding alarmed, that the Trump people called General Klotz, on the day before Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th president of the United States, and asked him to bring back the stuff he had taken home and move back into his office. Aside from him, the people with the most intimate knowledge of the problems and the possibilities of the D.O.E. walked out the door.  Or as Lewis reports on Perry himself:  The question on the minds of the people who currently work at the department: Does he know what it does now? D.O.E. press secretary Shaylyn Hynes assures us that “Secretary Perry is dedicated to the missions of the Department of Energy.” And in his hearings, Perry made a show of having educated himself. He said how useful it was to be briefed by former secretary Ernest Moniz. But when I asked someone familiar with those briefings how many hours Perry had spent with Moniz, he laughed and said, “That’s the wrong unit of account.” With the nuclear physicist who understood the D.O.E. perhaps better than anyone else on earth, according to one person familiar with the meeting, Perry had spent minutes, not hours. “He has no personal interest in understanding what we do and effecting change,” a D.O.E. staffer told me in June. “He’s never been briefed on a program—not a single one, which to me is shocking.”  Similarly, The Post's Steven Mufson and Chris Mooney report that Perry \"is seen as lacking influence over the agency’s direction.\"  The whole piece is worth a read.  EPA Administrator Pruitt at the White House (EPA/MICHAEL REYNOLDS)  -- Oh, Canada: “Two months before beginning a purge of scientists from his agency, Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt met with former Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper ― a head of state who became infamous for muzzling climate researchers during his tenure,” HuffPost's Alexander C. Kaufman reported Wednesday. “According to emails HuffPost has obtained, the March 27 meeting, scheduled to last 30 minutes, was meant to establish a rapport between the new environmental regulator and the conservative former premier. But it’s notable that Harper was accused of transforming Canada into a petrostate and overseeing an assault on scientific research during his nine years in Ottawa. He left office in 2015, after losing to now-Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\"  -- One EPA employee is hoping to milk impending buyouts for all its worth. \"Make me an offer I can't refuse,\" the employee wrote in reply to an internal EPA request that was surveying interest on buyouts, E&E reported. Trump’s proposed cuts to the agency’s 2018 budget could result in about 3,800 fewer jobs, though lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have challenged those proposals. Wednesday was the deadline for EPA employees to respond to the agency’s first round of buyout offers. The EPA hopes to cut the staff by 1,227 by September, per the report.  -- Senate and House leaders struck a deal late Wednesday to send a long-debated sanctions bill imposing new measures against Russia, Iran and North Korea to the president’s desk, The Post's Karoun Demirjian reports.  The Russia portion of the sanctions — and the energy industry consequences of them — appear to be hammered out. At issue during this latest round of negotiations were “enhancements,\" as Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) put it, to the punitive measures against North Korea.  OIL CHECK  Traffic queues in central London in February. (AFP PHOTO / Daniel LEAL-OLIVASDANIEL LEAL-OLIVAS/AFP/Getty Images)  -- Britain plans to ban new diesel and gas cars by 2040: \"Scrambling to combat a growing air pollution crisis, Britain announced on Wednesday that sales of new diesel and gas cars would reach the end of the road by 2040, the latest step in Europe’s battle against the damaging environmental impact of the internal combustion engine,\" the New York Times reported. \"Britain’s plans match a similar pledge made this month by France, and are part of a growing global push to curb emissions and fight climate change by promoting electric cars. Carmakers are also adjusting, with Volvo notably saying recently that it would phase out the internal combustion engine in the coming years and BMW deciding to build an electric version of its popular Mini car in Britain. But the shift to electric vehicles will be a gradual one, and the target set by Britain is less ambitious than some of the efforts elsewhere. President Trump’s decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord has also dented optimism.\"  ALTERNATIVE UNIVERSE  -- \"I got there the next day\": On Wednesday night's \"Late Night with Seth Meyers,\" Andrea Mitchell, chief foreign affairs correspondent for NBC News, relayed an anecdote from her time as an energy correspondent while reporting on Three Mile Island:  Meyers: What happened when you tried to report from Three Mile Island? Mitchell: Well, a very kindly, paternalistic bureau chief, a lovely man, said – when I noticed that I was the only correspondent not going in and covering this thing. I went, and said, “how come I’m the only one not going to Three Mile Island?” And he said, “because you are a woman of child-bearing age.” And I said, “has it occurred to you that men’s balls areas vulnerable to radiation as women’s ovaries?” I mean, I got there the next day.  -- President Trump may be doubling back on a pledge to save the ethanol industry, Bloomberg writes in a long-read published yesterday. Trump traveled to counties with ethanol plants across the Midwest during his campaign, repeatedly vowing to protect and support biofuels. On June 21, Trump traveled to Iowa and told the crowd “we’re saving your ethanol industries in the state of Iowa just like I promised I would do in my campaign… Believe me, they are under siege folks.”  Just two weeks later, Trump’s EPA proposed a cut to renewable fuel mandates. A relatively small cut thought it was, Bloomberg notes that it that it sends a message to the investors in the industry, and to the counties across the country that support Trump by 95 percent.  “If he was looking to do something that would have taken care of the agricultural sector that got him elected, this was a no-brainer,” Tom Brooke, who runs a biodiesel plant in Iowa told the publication. “That’s the disconnect. It should’ve been a slam-dunk.”  The proposed cuts will get a public hearing on August 1, and the deadline for the EPA to finalize the rule is November 30.  THERMOMETER  A farmer works in a corn field in China. (REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File Photo)  -- Another consequence of climate change — corn: A new study found that drought that results from climate change could impact areas that produce 40 percent of the world’s corn all at one time, Bloomberg reported.  \"We haven't seen a major drought in the U.S. and China in the same year in the last 30 years,\" Chris Kent, the lead researcher on the study, told Bloomberg. \"Our simulations indicate that that type of scenario is possible in the current climate.\" According to the National Corn Growers Association, the U.S. produced more than 15 billion bushels and harvested nearly 27 million acres of corn in 2016.  More from Bloomberg: “In the U.S., the chance of all six Corn Belt states simultaneously experiencing severe water stress is about 20 percent per decade… For the three provinces of the North East China Plain, the probability of one province to experience severe water stress is 33 percent per decade, consistent with other observational estimates. However, the model also included simulations—unprecedented in observational data sets—in which two, or even three, of these global regions experience severe water stress concurrently.”  DAYBOOK  Energy Secretary Rick Perry.

The federation has been arguing against a carbon tax being imposed across the country.  It’s anticipated the federal government will impose a carbon tax system for provinces and territories that do not develop their own pricing system on carbon.  The CTF has a bumper sticker campaign underway protesting the plan.  It’s been making free stickers stating “No Carbon Tax” available to the public through its website (www.taxpayer.com) along with a series of petitions against the tax directed at Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and provincial/territorial governments.  “With potential costs of up to $2,569 per year for the average Canadian family by 2022, the carbon tax will also increase the price of food and clothing,” it’s highlighted on the federation’s website.  “It will mean lost jobs and struggling or bankrupt businesses, but it won’t make a dent in climate change.  “The carbon tax will hit rural Canadians particularly hard, where driving is a necessity.  “Our economy is fragile, and the last thing it needs is yet another tax to make life more difficult for families and businesses.”  In a statement specific to the Yukon, the CTF highlighted Premier Sandy Silver’s comments last year that he would work with the federal government on bringing a carbon tax to the Yukon, though details won’t be available until the fall.  In June, Silver told reporters the Liberal government stands behind its position that carbon pricing can help combat climate change with people and businesses reducing their fuel consumption.  “We still are behind the statement,” Silver said then.  “We do believe that carbon pricing mechanisms are the most effective way of dealing with man-made climate change.”  In an email this morning, Aaron Wudrick, the CTF’s federal director, described the Yukon petition as a “natural evolution” in the fight against the carbon tax.  The federal government did confirm earlier this year the possibility of an exemption to the carbon tax for the territory, but the Yukon government continues to push ahead with plans for the carbon tax, the CTF pointed out.  “The carbon tax will clearly hurt Yukoners more than most,” said Paige MacPherson, the CTF’s Alberta director.  “Driving and heating your home aren’t optional in Yukon. They’re necessities of life – and Yukon taxpayers shouldn’t be punished for that.”  The organization goes on to note a carbon tax could result in higher prices and potential job cuts as the tax is added to anything that is shipped.  “Industrial operations and mining sites will find it harder to compete,” MacPherson said.  “Airplane fuel costs will hurt tourism. Even schools and hospitals will be hard-hit by higher heating and transportation costs.”  A number of provinces have already started pushing back against the federal government plans to impose the tax.  “Yukoners who oppose the carbon tax are not alone in this fight,” Wudrick said.  “Canadians from coast to coast to coast are actively opposing Prime Minister Trudeau’s carbon tax. We started this petition to give Yukoners one way to stand up and be heard.”  Wudrick said he expects when provincial elections come up, the organization will get an even better sense of how the issue is resonating with taxpayers.  The federation also pointed out an Angus-Reid poll released earlier this month shows popular support for the tax is declining.  “Most Canadians agree environmental issues are important, but they’re also worried that carbon taxes won’t achieve much for the environment while having a lot of detrimental consequences to the economy and families’ pocketbooks,” Wudrick said.  The petition and other CTF materials are available through the organization’s website."},{"url":"browse://www.propertycasualty360.com/2017/07/27/autonomous-vehicle-technology-could-shrink-auto-in","title":"Autonomous vehicle technology could shrink auto insurance sector by 71%","short_content":"Autonomous technology is making cars increasingly safer, leading to a potential 90% reduction in accident frequency by 2050.\nThe rapid adoption of mobility-on-demand is quickly translating into the need for less personal auto coverage, with the use of fleets requiring commercial auto insurance.\nAuto manufacturers will assume more of the driving risk and associated liability, and have new opportunities to provide insurance to car buyers, taking market share away from traditional insurers.","content":""},{"url":"http://leaderpost.com/opinion/letters/letter-trudeaus-carbon-tax-is-poorly-designed","title":"Letter: Trudeau's carbon tax is poorly designed - Regina Leader-Post","short_content":"","content":"I must say a resounding “no” to Trudeau’s carbon tax. The reason is that the carbon tax is supposed to provide a financial incentive for consumers to alter their behaviour. Think of the time before the GST when we had a manufacturer’s tax. It fell on producers and processors. Large companies passed on the cost by charging higher prices. Smaller companies did not have that marketing power and had to eat the tax. It was an unfair tax for producers and processors and invisible to consumers. The GST was its replacement. It was transparent because, at the till, it was a separate add-on after the market price. Trudeau’s carbon tax follows in the failed footsteps of the manufacturer’s tax with the same potential negative effects on producers and processors. Consumers’ behaviour, the main object, will not be altered because the tax will be embedded and invisible in the end price. We need a carbon tax that is visible like the GST and is mandated as a separate item from the market price as the product flows down the supply chain. When consumers come to choose brand X or brand Y off the shelf, they need to see the difference in the carbon content, by virtue of the tax applied, so they can make an informed choice. Clearly, Trudeau’s tax is not designed to do that.

As competitive pressures mount, Hyundai is moving up the debut of its newest advanced driver-assistance system &#40;ADAS&#41;, according to TechCrunch.  Initially slated for initial release in 2019 or 2020, Hyundai will beginincluding its Highway Driving Assist 2 (HDA2) system in vehicles in late 2018.  Hyundai’s new system will allow vehicles to drive autonomously on highways with a driver monitoring the system but not actively controlling the car. The vehicle will control speed and stay in its lane safely, but will also be able to change lanes or move from an auxiliary roadway to a main roadway on its own, according to the Electronic Times. To accomplish this, Hyundai will include additional sensors in its vehicles, giving them 360-degree detection capabilities, rather than just front and back as it currently includes.  Hyundai is likely moving up its semi-autonomous plans in response to moves from Cadillacand Audi, which will be releasing vehicles with ADASs in this year and 2018, respectively. These semi-autonomous systems are coming to luxury vehicles first, and it seems as if automakers are racing to include these features to avoid being left behind in a competitive marketplace. Given the cost that goes into research for these systems, though, especially compared to shipment numbers for luxury vehicles, these features will likely make their way down car makers’ lineups in the coming years. BI Intelligence expects semi-autonomous vehicle shipments to rise to almost 1.4 million by 2021 as these features start in the luxury segment but begin to spread to mid-level vehicles as well.

Will we still be driving, or will we be living in a utopia filled with gleaming white pods silently whizzing about the streets ferrying people to and fro?  The car of the future is still in flux. While many agree that it will be autonomous, will hopefully be accident-free, probably battery powered and will likely be radically different on the inside, if still familiar on the outside, there are broadly two routes down which the car can wind to 2040.  The first is the model we are familiar with: car ownership. There are more than 34.4m cars on British roads, with a new record of 2.69m sold in 2016 in an industry worth £77.5bn a year, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. It’s clear the British still love their cars.  Automotive manufacturers across the globe would love nothing more than the current model of private car ownership to continue. A car parked outside every home, new models bought on registration plate changes and regular servicing at your local garage, just with the car able to drive itself there for a robot to do the work.  That route could see the car transform from a vehicle into a moving personal space. Once it drives itself, there’s no need to have the traditional layout – or even to face forward.  The car as luxury item  Mike Ramsey, a research director for Gartner, said: “The inside of the vehicle of 2040 will be luxurious. Indeed, cars that are personally owned are likely to become increasingly luxurious, as people who use a car for simple commuting either will be buying used models or using mobility services.  “The most capable, luxurious cars likely will have features like chairs that can face one another and heads up displays that are richer in detail than those available today.”  Mercedes showed off the F 015 Luxury in Motion concept car at CES in Las Vegas in 2015, which had vast doors with pillar-less frames through which the passengers stepped into four seats facing each other with screens in the doors. Others have envisioned pods rather than traditional-looking cars where the space inside the car is less a driving machine and more of a mobile office or lounge.  Research by car black-box insurance firm Ingenie found the key changes for cars between now and 2045 will be the adoption of technologies already in use in other areas. Instead of a key you could have a fingerprint sensor, iris scanner or other biometric system to identify you as you walk up and open the door. The windows will be active with touchscreens and gesture controls, and the cars would not only be autonomous but smart on the inside, with computers programmed to do your bidding.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Uber, Lyft and other taxi firms have ploughed vast sums into autonomous vehicle research. Photograph: Angelo Merendino/AFP/Getty Images  Ramsey said: “The multimedia centre will be more interactive, with a powerful virtual assistant that has far more capability than today. It is likely that buttons and controls will disappear as the voice assistant takes most of those controls away.”  You’ll get into your car, tell it you’re heading into work and it will communicate with streets, cars and infrastructure to find the best route not only for you, but the flow of other commuters. You’ll then sit back and wait for the car to drop you off at the door.  Once you and your fellow travelling companions have disembarked, the car will then head to the nearest charging station to park up for the day, awaiting your command to return and whisk you home, off to the theatre, the local sports complex or to the pub, which has been given a new lease of life now no one has to be be sober to get home.  The car as public service  The other road to the 2040 car is the exact opposite. Once cars are fully autonomous there’s no reason they couldn’t become a service rather than something you buy and own. Car clubs such as ZipCar already offer cars without ownership, while services such as Uber and Lyft provide on-demand transport wherever you want to go.  Take the human element out of the equation and it’s not hard to envision a world populated, not by cars, but by public transport pods.  Ramsey said: “For mobility services, cars may become more commoditised, taking the shape of people movers – efficient, packaged to hold people, slow moving and utilitarian.”  Order one, it comes and picks you up, drops you off and then zips off to the next person or back to the charger. In doing so it would see cars switched to a 90% used state, rather than sitting around unused most of the day, and in doing so could reduce the number of vehicles on the road.  Uber, Lyft and other taxi firms have ploughed vast sums into autonomous vehicle research to that end, while many of Britain’s autonomous car developments have been focused on services that mimic public transport.  A mixture of the two or some other hybrid by the time 2040 rolls around is entirely possible, and there may be a period when human drivers will be banned or at the very least driving for transport rather than leisure will be seen as the exception.  What is clear is that motors powering the cars of 2040 will be some form of electric, which means more batteries, silent running and charging stations everywhere."},{"url":"browse://qz.com/1034116/the-entangling-alliances-of-the-self-driving-car-world-visualized/","title":"The entangling alliances of the self-driving car world, visualized","short_content":"“It’s hard to keep track of who’s working with who and what’s going on,” Lyft chief strategy officer Raj Kapoor told journalists last week, speaking about self-driving car partnerships.\nQuartz looked at 33 companies that have publicly partnered with at least one other company to pursue work on self-driving cars.\nThere are many reasons companies would want to partner: sharing data, integrating hardware and software, collaborating on open-source software.\nNvidia, a graphics-chip manufacturer that has ventured into building embeddable computers to power self-driving cars, is incredibly well situated, working with eight automakers.\nIt’s partnered with nearly every big player in hardware, ostensibly to make Apollo work with any combination of sensors that might be found on a self-driving car.","content":"“It’s hard to keep track of who’s working with who and what’s going on,” Lyft chief strategy officer Raj Kapoor told journalists last week, speaking about self-driving car partnerships.  We agree.  While fully autonomous cars might not really hit the roads for a few years (or ever!), automakers, tech companies, auto suppliers, and even car-rental services have woven an intricate web of partnerships that’s become difficult to untangle.  Quartz looked at 33 companies that have publicly partnered with at least one other company to pursue work on self-driving cars.  There are many reasons companies would want to partner: sharing data, integrating hardware and software, collaborating on open-source software. Data, as has been shown time and time again, is immensely important and likely often a driving factor.  The public details of these partnerships are often vague. For instance, Chinese search giant Baidu has taken a page from Google’s ubiquitous Android operating system by releasing a free and open-source operating system for self-driving cars called Apollo, and has announced partnerships with automakers like Ford and Daimler. Will automakers’ cars use the operating system, or just parts? Will they contribute code? Will they share data?  What is clear, however, is that automakers are relying on hardware and software from Silicon Valley to make this technology work. Nvidia, a graphics-chip manufacturer that has ventured into building embeddable computers to power self-driving cars, is incredibly well situated, working with eight automakers. One of those companies is Tesla, which uses Nvidia chips to power every single one of its cars.  Outside of just automakers, Baidu is also well-connected. It’s partnered with nearly every big player in hardware, ostensibly to make Apollo work with any combination of sensors that might be found on a self-driving car.  It’s worth noting that while not formally partnered, sensors from MobileEye and Velodyne have been seen on the research vehicles of companies such as Apple and Waymo—this graphic doesn’t comprehensively cover which hardware companies are supplying others."},{"url":"http://www.kbtx.com/content/news/Focus-at-Four-Take-a-ride-with-no-driver-in-AMs-autonomous-vehicle-436826053.html","title":"Focus at Four: Take a ride with no driver in A&M's autonomous vehicle - KBTX","short_content":"That's the point behind Texas A&M University's autonomous golf cart, now testing as a shuttle for public passengers.\n\"A big part of our research is to make sure passengers and pedestrians trust the autonomous vehicle.\"\n\"Maybe 10 to 15 running on campus, and you have an app like Uber or Lyft, and you can call an autonomous vehicle to come pick you up.\"\nIf you'd like to take a ride in the self-driving golf cart, hop on at the Stella Hotel in Bryan.\nThe autonomous shuttle will be rolling Wednesday, Thursday and Friday from 10 a.m. until noon and again from 4 p.m. until 6 p.m.","content":"It's the car so smart, it drives you.

By Michaela Ross  The House Energy and Commerce Committee plans to mark up a bill July 27 that would regulate autonomous vehicles, amid questions about whether lawmakers should set cybersecurity standards for the emerging technology.  U.S. drivers may be slow to adopt autonomous vehicles being developed by companies such as Ford Motor Co. and Tesla Inc. because of worries about hacks that could result in vehicle theft or harm to occupants, consumer surveys have shown. Cybersecurity fears are second only to worries about perceived higher vehicle expenses among barriers to consumer adoption, according to a September 2016 survey by Kelley Blue Book, a vehicle research and valuation company.  “I think every single member up here is worried about cybersecurity and privacy,” Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.) told Bloomberg BNA recently. “How do you make sure you’re moving fast enough with the speed at which technology is changing, but at the same time not moving so fast as for somebody to get hurt?”  Lawmakers, autonomous vehicle industry groups and consumer and safety advocacy groups agree that a cybersecurity framework is needed to spur consumer adoption. But they disagree on whether the government should establish the framework, leave it to the private sector, or find a compromise between the approaches.  “Even with a multi-layer defense against cyber threats, automakers must be nimble and adaptive because the cyber world is always changing,” Gloria Bergquist, vice president at the trade group Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, told Bloomberg BNA. “Locking in what seems proactive now may not be so effective when the future demands another approach.”  Up to the Task?  There is also widespread concern among lawmakers, autonomous vehicle industry groups and consumer and safety advocacy groups that the Department of Transportation’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the federal government agency that would be in charge of implementing a vehicle cybersecurity plan, does not have sufficient expertise or resources to handle the task. A NHTSA spokesperson did not immediately respond to a Bloomberg BNA request for comment.  Marc Scribner, a fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, said the gaps in cybersecurity policy in an agency draft rule issued on connected cars in 2016 is cause for concern that NHTSA won’t be able to meet the challenge of writing autonomous vehicle cybersecurity standards.  “I think it’s very naive of Congress to think that they can just fix this with more legislation, especially charging an agency to do more, when it’s proven that it can’t do what it’s supposed to be doing right now,” Scribner told Bloomberg BNA.  Dingell told Bloomberg BNA July 19 that lawmakers are aware that NHTSA does not currently have the resources or staff to address autonomous vehicle issues.  “NHTSA doesn’t have money it needs,” Dingell said. “We are not funding these kinds of agencies at the levels they need to be funded to do what they’ve got to do.”  Congress Tackles Cyber  House and Senate lawmakers have taken different approaches to autonomous vehicle cybersecurity so far. The House committee is taking up a bill (H.R. 3388) by Rep. Bob Latta (R-Ohio). The panel’s Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection Subcommittee approved a draft of the bill July 19 that called for autonomous vehicle companies to develop a cybersecurity plan.  Lawmakers have since been negotiating over language that may mandate that NHTSA approve the industry plan. It was unclear July 26 whether those negotiations were successful, but the full committee said late July 25 it would consider a substitute amendment to the bill during its markup.  Senate lawmakers, including Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee Chairman John Thune (R-S.D.) circulated a legislative proposal earlier this month that took a more expansive approach in its cybersecurity section, according to several industry stakeholders who viewed the proposal.  The Senate proposal called for partnering NHTSA with the Auto-ISAC , an industry-led group created in 2015 through a presidential directive to share cybersecurity vulnerabilities and threat information, the industry sources said. The proposal appeared to direct the Department of Transportation to use enforcement authorities and publish guidelines for when cyber vulnerabilities constitute a safety defect, the sources said.  Shifting Standards  Cybersecurity researchers and industry groups are concerned that mandating particular security standards may make technologies more vulnerable by feeding hackers information about a company’s plans or creating a rigid framework that can’t easily be adapted for fast-moving threats.  There are also gaps and conflicts in federal agency jurisdiction over cybersecurity standard-setting. Acting Federal Trade Commission Chairman Maureen Ohlhausen said during a June workshop that the FTC should address consumer privacy and data security issues around connected cars, but should avoid conflicting with NHTSA’s oversight of vehicles.  NHTSA’ September 2016 guidelines for autonomous vehicles nodded to the need to assess cyber threats and vulnerabilities, but stopped short of mandating standards, stating cybersecurity is an “evolving area” and “more research is necessary before proposing a regulatory standard.” In October, the agency released a series of best practices for cybersecurity in all vehicles.  Some lawmakers, cybersecurity researchers and industry officials say that cybersecurity measures are best left to the private sector, because it has a strong incentive to avoid the litigation and bad publicity that likely would follow an autonomous vehicle hack.  Still, consumer advocacy groups say industry promises aren’t enough. In a July 18 letter to lawmakers, groups including Citizens for Reliable and Safe Highways and Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety called for NHTSA to issue cybersecurity standards within three years after Congress passes an autonomous vehicle bill.  – With assistance from Jimmy H.

But our personal mobility options remain, today and for the foreseeable future, earthbound. Will the promise of self-driving cars be as elusive? In short, no. The dream of taking a road trip in which we pay more attention to a new book or movie than we do to the driving task is well within reach.  Still, we’re not there yet. And people are just beginning to ask a very important question: How might our nation’s roads and highways, and the driving done by we humans ourselves, need to change as autonomous vehicles become more ubiquitous? As researchers at the Texas A&M Transportation Institute who study many of the implications of self-driving cars, we find the answer in two important sets of realities – those we know, and those we don’t know.  For starters, we know that self-driving cars won’t become commonplace overnight. The vast majority of cars on the road now have no automation features or only very limited automation, like cruise control. You can find a few self-driving cars being tested on public roads now if you know where to look. But you won’t likely find many in a dealer showroom for at least 10 years.  Another factor that will further delay the widespread use of autonomous cars is that many people hang on to their cars as long as possible. The number of highly automated cars as a share of everything on the road will grow over time, but only relatively slowly.  In addition, we can be quite confident that autonomous cars will appear on city streets before they make it to the interstate highways. The reasons have more to do with public policy than they do with technology. Local governments are typically more nimble than state and federal agencies, which is one reason why you can find robotic taxis being tested right now on the streets of Pittsburgh, Phoenix and San Francisco.  Interstate highway operations and safety rules are governed by state and federal laws and regulations, which are much more complex. For the most part, self-driving cars will be ready for the open road long before the open road is ready for them.  Another factor delaying the widespread use of self-driving cars is money. The transformations that will support autonomous travel won’t be cheap. That’s true for the private companies designing and building self-driving cars, and for the taxpayer-funded government agencies that design and build the roads on which they’ll drive. Ensuring cars can communicate with each other will require industry investment; their ability to converse with roads, pavement markings, road signs and traffic signals will need government support.  Yet some states already are short of money they need to repair existing roads and bridges, much less build new ones or add technology to the mix. The certainly high price tag raises vexing questions about our current (and likely outdated) funding system.  That gives us a good start when imagining what could be possible in a world with more autonomous cars on the road. But there is still a lot we don’t know.  Some unknowns are fairly technical. How well will autonomous vehicles operate in rain or snow? And how will they handle changing conditions on unpaved roads, which make up nearly half of the country’s 4 million miles of road?  Other unknowns are more about the transportation system as a whole. Will self-driving cars help to ease traffic congestion, or make it worse? Without a lot of autonomous cars in the world to test or experiment with, we’re left to rely on computer modeling to aid our search for answers. To say that modeling the effects of these vehicles in a real-world setting is complex is putting it lightly; making allowances for unpredictable human behavior in that modeling only compounds the complexity. For now, any argument that self-driving cars will be an antidote for congestion may be, at best, uninformed and specious.  Will self-driving cars make our roadways dramatically safer? Most crashes result from human error, so it seems logical to assume that removing humans from the process reduces the likelihood of a crash. We’re long on hopes here, but so far short on evidence, especially about what might happen during the transition period when both self-driving and conventional vehicles are sharing the roads. There is reason for cautious optimism, because federal agencies do have preliminary data suggesting that the safety performance of some self-driving cars is better than national human-driving averages.  We don’t know whether car ownership trends will change. People might want their own personal self-driving auto, or maybe they’ll just want to call a robotaxi whenever they need a ride. TTI research showed that respondents in one Texas city were evenly split, 50-50, on whether they’d ever travel in a self-driving car. We expect that as people experience more automation in their cars and become knowledgeable about potential safety and other benefits, acceptance and likely adoption will increase. It’s unclear how people will spend their time in a car that drives itself and how that might influence other travel-related decisions, including decisions about traveling more, or less.  What drivers will need to know will have to change, too, in ways that aren’t entirely clear. We’ll have to adapt driver education programs and tests to ensure people understand how to operate self-driving vehicles safely. We’ll all need to know about humans’ roles in emergency procedures, maintenance tasks or other new elements of autonomous driving.  And what about liability? If a car with no driver is involved in a crash (yes, that happened), who’s at fault? If a car with no driver is stopped by a police officer for driving too slowly (yes, that happened, too), to whom should the citation be issued? For the time being, the onus is on the human driver who must remain alert and be ready to take over vehicle operations.  This list of queries is merely a start. As with any emerging research and development venture, unforeseen issues and new questions will arise. Put another way, we don’t yet fully know what we don’t know.  What is certain is that we’re experiencing the most pivotal time in transportation history since we started building interstate highways. Our cars won’t be able to fly, but they will be much more capable than we’re used to. They’re not quite ready yet – and we’re not either – but it won’t be long. We can expect it to be an eventful ride, no matter who’s in the driver’s seat.  This article was originally published on The Conversation.

Texas is now one of 17 states (Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Michigan, New York, Nevada, North Dakota, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, Vermont, plus Washington D.C.) that have passed legislation related to AVs. Governors in Arizona, Massachusetts, Washington and Wisconsin have also issued executive orders related to AVs. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker has formed a committee to determine AV best practices, and Washington Governor Jay Inslee formed a similar interagency work group.  According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 33 states have introduced legislation related to AVs thus far in 2017. Some municipalities are also looking to welcome AVs to their streets. Late last year test projects were launched in Boston, and its Mayor is committed to developing policy recommendations for regulating AV technology and use. But the wave of state and municipal actions creating standards for the use of AVs could lead to a patchwork of laws that some in the industry fear will burden manufacturers and drivers. They prefer a nationwide standard.  Federal lawmakers are attentive to these concerns, and are working to respond. Earlier this year Senators John Thune (R-S.D.) and Gary Peters (D-Mich.) began drafting proposed bipartisan legislation intended to encourage innovators to continue advancing self-driving technology while still maintaining driver safety. On June 13, they joined with Senator Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) to announce a framework for legislation that aims to clarify the role of state and federal governments in regulating the use of AVs. They hope to have a bill ready by August.  On the House side, the Energy and Commerce subcommittee recently circulated discussion drafts of 14 different bills concerning national laws for AVs, each addressing different issues facing this burgeoning industry. One bill targets design and production, forbidding states and municipalities from regulating the “design, construction, mechanical systems, software systems, or communications systems” of AVs. Another would reaffirm state authority over issues such as insurance, licensing, registration, and traffic regulation.  With state and federal legislation on the horizon, companies involved in the development of AV technology must prepare for the legal issues it will present. AV advocates assert that the technology can drastically reduce the number of traffic-related fatalities on U.S. roads, but new liability issues will also arise. One high profile fatal accident has already highlighted those issues. In May 2016, Ohio resident Joshua Brown was killed in a Florida accident when his Tesla Model S equipped with Tesla’s Autopilot system collided with a semi-trailer truck. The accident immediately raised national concern about the safety of AV-equipped cars.  In January 2017, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration issued a report stating that it had discovered no defects in Tesla’s Autopilot system, and that it could reduce accidents by as much as 40%. The National Transportation Safety Board also opened an investigation of the accident, and on June 19, 2017 issued a preliminary factual report. The NTSB found that the driver ignored seven visual warnings on the instrument panel and six aural warning to “hold steering wheel” before the crash, and had his hands off the wheel for 37 minutes before the impact. These findings highlight the fact that Autopilot-equipped cars are not self-driving. But it could be argued as a basis for design defect and failure to warn claims that the “Autopilot” name implies a self-driving capability, and thereby encourages drivers to be less vigilant and attentive to their surroundings and potential dangers. Despite the NHTSA finding that the Autopilot system could significantly reduce accidents, it did not prevent this fatality.  As with other new developments, AV technology gives rise to new issues which Congress and state governments are beginning to address. Designers and manufacturers must strive to enhance potential safety benefits, to reduce the chances for driver confusion, and to make both the capabilities and the limitations of the technology clear to users. AV systems can be designed to capture data and driver actions to improve their systems and to deal with new liability exposures. The technology creates both opportunities and challenges for the industry, insurers, and lawyers."},{"url":"https://www.automotiveworld.com/analysis/av-deployment-far-yet-near/","title":"AV deployment – so far, yet so near - Automotive World (press release)","short_content":"The remarkable advances in autonomous vehicle (AV) technology are thanks to the innovations of OEMs, Tier 1s, technology companies and even policy makers.\nAt Autonomous Car Detroit – a one-day event hosted by Automotive Megatrends – industry experts came together to debate the issues facing AV deployment.\nIronically, while intended to be life-saving, humans naturally approach new technology with caution, especially when it could be life threatening.\nLegislationWith such rapid advances in AV technology, legislation is in danger of falling behind.\nPart of NHTSA’s recent proposal for a legislative framework included governance on testing AV technology.","content":"Key takeaways from Autonomous Car Detroit 2017  Jumping into a car, stating where you want to go, and kicking back with a cup of coffee and a movie while being chauffeured to your destination by a driverless car – it’s long been the stuff of dreams. The remarkable advances in autonomous vehicle (AV) technology are thanks to the innovations of OEMs, Tier 1s, technology companies and even policy makers. At Autonomous Car Detroit – a one-day event hosted by Automotive Megatrends – industry experts came together to debate the issues facing AV deployment. Michael Nash summarises the key takeaways  Safety first  Statistics from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) show road traffic deaths are on the rise, and although safety tech in the automotive industry has come a long way in recent years, the widespread deployment of AVs may be the only way to achieve ‘Vision Zero’. Ironically, while intended to be life-saving, humans naturally approach new technology with caution, especially when it could be life threatening. Michael James of Toyota Research Institute (TRI) thinks today’s consumers are reluctant to place their trust in AVs – firstly because they don’t yet have faith in the technology, and secondly because of exposure and vulnerability to hacking.  Sharing is caring  You’re young, living in a bustling megacity, and reading/working/surfing during your train commute has become one of your favourite pastimes. Driving isn’t an option: car parking is a challenge and expensive to come by, but ride-sharing may be useful for the last mile or two of most of your journeys. De la Vergne has good news for you: he thinks autonomous and electrified ride-sharing fleets could soon pop up in cities all over the world.  Legislation  With such rapid advances in AV technology, legislation is in danger of falling behind. It’s the view of Ian Graig, Chief Executive of Global Policy Group, that writing policy is a lengthy process, and therefore AVs “pose a real challenge to how legislation has traditionally been made.” Although it could be vital for the technology’s success, Matt Smith, Michigan Department of Transportation, warned that delays in the construction of a legislative framework run the risk of delaying AV deployment.  Tried and tested?  Part of NHTSA’s recent proposal for a legislative framework included governance on testing AV technology. Numerous OEMs already have licenses to test AVs on public roads, and some ride-sharing companies have made AVs available to the general public. James of TRI holds the view that testing is critical to decipher what needs to be done before AVs can be widely adopted: “Nobody has an answer to what performance levels we require from these vehicles. Is it human-level or is it beyond? Real-world tests are crucial for us to find out.”  Mobility for all  Central to the pro-AV argument is making mobility easier and more accessible, though price is a concern. Mark de la Vergne, the City of Detroit’s Chief of Mobility Innovation, suggested that AVs should not be a symbol of income, status or class, but should be available to everyone. Could there be such thing as a low-cost entry-level AV? Today the technology is expensive, but with scale comes affordability. Autonomous taxis could also make transport easier for less mobile individuals, helping them obtain the independence they crave, said Carla Bailo of Ohio State University.

Speaking on the eve of the Senate's critical vote that could seal the fate of Republican efforts to repeal Obamacare, Trump drew on the stories of struggle of Americans who joined him at the White House to remind Republicans of their seven year-old promise to repeal and replace Obamacare.  \"For the last seven years, Republicans have been united in standing up for Obamacare's victims. Remember repeal and replace, repeal and replace, they kept saying it over and over again. Every Republican running for office promised immediate relief from this disastrous law,\" Trump said. \"We, as a party, must fulfill that solemn promise to the voters of this country to repeal and replace.  \"But so far, Senate Republicans have not done their job in ending the Obamacare nightmare. They now have a chance however to hopefully -- hopefully -- fix what has been so badly broken for such a long time and that is through replacement of a horrible, disaster known as Obamacare,\" Trump added.  Vice President Mike Pence visited Capitol Hill Monday afternoon to meet with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky.  The plan is for the Senate to take a major procedural vote Tuesday afternoon to advance the bill to overhaul health care Tuesday, the No. 2 Senate Republican, Sen. John Cornyn, told reporters.  What exactly lawmakers will ultimately be voting for, however, remains unclear.  Cornyn, asked what leadership ultimately wants the bill to be at the end, said: \"We're not quite there yet.\"  A simple majority is needed to pass the motion to proceed, and Republicans can only afford to lose two votes, something made more difficult with GOP Sen. John McCain remaining at home in Arizona as he recovers from surgery.  Trump weaved the stories of several Americans who have experienced the pitfalls of Obamacare firsthand into his effort to pressure Republicans.  He noted the story of Steve Finn, a former police officer who faced \"skyrocketing costs\" and told the story of Marjorie and Kevin Weer who were \"emotionally and financially devastated\" as they tried to get their son care for his Spina Bifida through an Obamacare plan.  \"Tomorrow, the Senate will vote on whether to allow this urgently needed bill to come to the Senate floor for debate. The question for every senator, Democrat or Republican, is whether they will side with Obamacare's architects, which have been so destructive to our country, or with its forgotten victims. Any senator who votes against starting debate is telling America that you are fine with the Obamacare nightmare, which is what it is.\"  What are senators voting on?  McConnell had announced last week -- after a repeal and replace bill seemed immovable -- that the Senate would vote on a 2015 bill to repeal Obamacare. Trump then told senators during a lunch at the White House that he wanted them to bring up a repeal-and-replace bill they'd been crafting for months.  \"Apparently that's created some heartburn,\" Cornyn said of McConnell announcing senators would vote on the 2015 bill. \"But the point is I think it's a mistake to look at the sequence of the vote because every provision has a right to a vote.\"  Asked about McConnell's earlier plan to bring up the 2015 repeal bill, Cornyn said, \"That's a big misunderstanding.\"  \"That's a big misunderstanding.... Everybody who wants to vote whether it's on the 2015 bill or the Cassidy-Collins bill or the Graham-Cassidy bill -- everybody's gonna get a chance to vote on everything,\" Cornyn said, emphasizing a process that could allow for open amendments that could begin if senators approve the motion Tuesday.  Speaking to reporters after an event with congressional Democrats event in Berryville, Virginia, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said \"no one knows\" what the plan is.  \"Not only am I not aware but when I talk to my Republican colleagues, at least of this morning, they were not aware,\" Schumer, D-New York, said. \"No one knows what Leader McConnell is going to put on the floor and that's causing a lot of consternation, not just among Democrats but among Republicans as well.\"  Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, a holdout on the bill, said confusion reigns among lawmakers.  \"We have no earthly idea what we will be voting on,\" Paul said on Fox News Monday afternoon. \"Last week they said we're going to vote on a clean repeal. I said hooray, that's what we promised. Now I'm told it may be the new Senate leadership bill, which is a big insurance bailout that I'm not for and doesn't repeal Obamacare.

The law, one of the first to be approved since President Emmanuel Macron's election in May, will apply to ministers and members of parliament, bringing France into line with countries like Germany and ending what is a widespread family business.  The essential clauses of the legislation were voted through by members of the National Assembly in votes Wednesday night and on Thursday.  Macron, a 39-year-old centrist, won the presidential contest promising he would end practices blamed for widespread voter distrust of politicians.  One of his hottest competitors in the presidential race was Fillon, a conservative ex-prime minister whose campaign was destroyed by a scandal involving payments to his British spouse Penelope.  The affair was exposed by media in late January, prompting a judicial inquiry, still underway, into allegations that Fillon paid wife Penelope hundreds of thousands of euros over years for little, if any, work as an assistant.  He also paid two of the couple's children for similar work.  Although he denounced what he called a dirty tricks campaign and denied having done anything illegal, he admitted an error of judgment. The scandal sank his bid for election and thrust the spotlight on the family hires of dozens of other politicians.  Roughly one in six members of parliament has a family member drawing a salary as an assistant.  Macron's government, whose debut as a clean-hands operation has been tainted by a separate inquiry that prompted a justice minister to resign, is also planning a crackdown on how freely MPs use the substantial budgets allotted to them.  Currently, members of the 577-member National Assembly get a budget of 130,000 euros ($152,000)a year - on top of their own pay and secretarial funds - which the new government says is too loosely controlled in the way it is used.  \"Members of parliament are there to adopt laws and not to be hand out subsidies,\" Nicole Belloubet, who replaced predecessor Francois Bayrou last month as justice minister, told Europe 1 radio.  The bill on family hires was criticized by some politicians, during a pre-vote debate where one of them, Julien Aubert of the opposition The Republicans party, said it was excessive. \"It's like pig flu: one pig is ill and the whole herd gets put down,\" he said.

EU President Jean-Claude Juncker said the bloc would act \"within days\" if it does not receive reassurances on the potential impact of new sanctions on European interests.  Russia also reacted angrily, saying the sanctions bill passed by the US House of Representatives on Tuesday risked worsening the already poor relations between the two countries.  The bill, drawn up largely in response to Moscow's alleged meddling in the 2016 US election, calls for new measures against Russia, North Korea and Iran. It also limits any effort by the White House to weaken such penalties.  The EU has previously coordinated with the US over sanctions in response to Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. But it fears the latest measures could hit companies that are involved in the financing of a controversial new pipeline, Nord Stream 2, that would carry natural gas from Russia to Germany.  Juncker said the bill could have \"unintended unilateral effects\" on the EU's energy security. \"This is why the Commission concluded today that if our concerns are not taken into account sufficiently, we stand ready to act appropriately within a matter of days,\" Juncker said. \"America first cannot mean that Europe's interests come last.\"  Germany, which strongly backs the new pipeline, said it was concerned over the sanctions. It would be \"unacceptable for the United States to use possible sanctions as an instrument to serve the interests of US industry policies,\" Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin Schäfer said Wednesday.  JUST WATCHED Russian leaders lash out at US sanctions Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Russian leaders lash out at US sanctions 01:29  France called the US bill \"unlawful\" due to its \"extraterritorial reach,\" saying it could impact Europeans if enacted. \"We have challenged similar texts in the past,\" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement. \"To protect ourselves against the extraterritorial effects of US legislation, we will have to work on adjusting our French and European laws.\"  If the bill clears a vote in the US Senate, it then heads to the desk of US President Donald Trump. It is not clear if that will happen before Congress breaks for summer recess at the end of the month.  Trump has not indicated whether he will sign the bill, which also gives Congress a way to block any easing of new sanctions against Russia, North Korea and Iran, as well as older ones against Russia.  The House action came hours after Jared Kushner, the President's son-in-law and senior adviser, was interviewed by the House Intelligence Committee about the 2016 campaign and allegations that the Trump campaign coordinated with Russian officials to help defeat his opponent, Hillary Clinton.  Trump's presidency has been dogged by questions his campaign's ties with Russia and his pre-election promises to improve relations with Moscow. The Trump administration and the Russian government have consistently denied collusion.  Anger in Moscow  Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov warned that \"the authors and sponsors of this legislation are taking a serious step towards the destruction of prospects for normalizing relations with Russia,\" according to state news agency Tass.  Ryabkov said the plan \"does not fit the framework of common sense\" but insisted Russia was \"not succumbing to emotions\" in its response.  \"We will work to find ways to move forward, persistently, consistently looking for ways of searching for compromise on issues, which are significant for Russia and, I think, for the US,\" he said.  The Kremlin said the proposed sanctions bill was \"sad news in terms of Russia-US relations\" and for the \"prospects of their development.\"  \"This is no less disappointing from the point of view of international law and international trade relations,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. But he added that Moscow would wait to form a full opinion until the draft becomes law.  Iran's President Hassan Rouhani said his country would respond to the US new sanctions, according to Iranian state broadcaster IRIB.  \"The US is continuing hostility towards Iran and Iran will definitely respond to US sanctions,\" Rouhani reportedly said during a cabinet meeting Wednesday. He did not say how Tehran would respond.  EU frustration  The European Union expressed frustration that it had not been consulted over the new proposals. \"New sanctions should always be coordinated between allies,\" EU President Jean-Claude Juncker said in a statement.  The EU and the US imposed coordinated sanctions in 2014 over Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. President Barack Obama imposed further sanctions in late 2016 over alleged interference in the 2016 US election. Sanctions were also imposed under the 2012 Magnitsky Act, which targets Russians whom the US considers human rights abusers.  The latest set of sanctions against Russia are intended to penalize its alleged election meddling, as well as its human rights violations, annexation of Crimea and military operations in eastern Ukraine.  The White House has been sending mixed messages about whether it will support the bill, which represents a challenge to the President's authority.  \"While the President supports tough sanctions on North Korea, Iran and Russia, the White House is reviewing the House legislation and awaits a final legislative package for the President's desk,\" White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Tuesday.  However, aides and members of Congress from both parties say that if Trump does decide to veto it, there will be sufficient votes to override the veto and enact the bill into law.  Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly ridiculed the sanctions and called on countries, particularly the United States, to drop them.

The startup, WayCare, uses historical and real-time data from freeway sensors, traffic lights, smartphones and vehicles equipped with certain onboard data systems. The data in WayCare’s predictive analytics platform includes vehicle speeds, counts and occupancies, traffic light timing and weather conditions. WayCare’s system, in addition to predicting traffic and traffic accidents, can also automatically identify incidents — like vehicles stopped on the side of the road — and act before the incident develops into anything more serious.  \"We’re bringing data into the city,\" said Noam Maital, WayCare’s chief executive officer.  According to Maital, one connected car could provide 200 times more data than Las Vegas has with all of its current road sensors. The Regional Transportation Commission (RTC) of Southern Nevada could use the predictions from WayCare to improve traffic flow through the pilot corridors. With Nevada dubbed the nation’s second-fastest growing state, managing traffic is only going to get more important.  But WayCare isn’t Las Vegas’s first traffic innovation rodeo. Las Vegas and the region of Southern Nevada are among leaders in the country when it comes to smart traffic projects. Audi, Nexar (another Israeli traffic startup) and GENIVI (a non-profit alliance working on traffic software) are all running pilots in the Silver state. Plus, there’s the autonomous bus testing and Cisco’s Smart+Connected Digital Platform pilot.  Driving smart traffic in Nevada  Nevada was the first state to put autonomous vehicle (AV) legislation on the books. Last month, new legislation that further promotes research and testing on Nevada roads was signed into law. In fact, the laws in Nevada are so AV-friendly that Dan Langford, the director of the Nevada Center for Advanced Mobility (NCAM), said if you could buy a fleet of autonomous vehicles, you could have them on Nevada roads today.  Previous autonomous testing showed that Las Vegas is ready for the technology. The downtown bus shuttle pilot had 10,000 riders in 10 days, and the city is already considering a second round.  “It was a very big success,” David Bowers, the director of Las Vegas Public Works told Smart Cities Dive in May. “There was a lot of excitement about it.”  But many of the projects in the works now are happening before widespread AV deployment. The city’s partnership with Cisco has deployed technology at 10 intersections to track lighting, traffic, crowd measurement, environmental and waste management.  \"What we are able to do with the technology now is bring in better types of data,” said Brian Hoeft, director of traffic management at RTC of Southern Nevada. This data is good, Hoeft said, for current drivers — but is also setting up for the roads of the future.  At the Consumer Electronics Show's (CES) Smart Cities Hackathon, Las Vegas offered city data for teams to use. One team developed an app for Amazon’s Alexa that can tell if street lights are working correctly using historical data. The city has been in touch with the team to try out the technology since the hackathon.  Outside of apps and sensor pilots, Audi has a project that is car-based. Certain models with the technology can get data from a connected traffic light system, with drivers getting sneak-previews of upcoming red lights and countdown timers displayed on their dashboard. Drivers also need an Audi connect PRIME subscription, with updates via the cars’ 4G LTE connections. RTC provides traffic signal data to Traffic Technology Services (TTS), an independent telematics company that sends the data to Audi. It’s available in Las Vegas first because of the city’s half-million dollar upgrades to its traffic lights.  Nexar’s vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) network turns smartphones into smart dashboard cameras. Using the phone’s camera, accelerometer and gyroscope, Nexar collects data and sends it to the cloud and other drivers using the Nexar app. Drivers using state vehicles will get the app first in the first statewide vehicle-to-vehicle network. Nexar’s network has reported a 24% reduction in accidents in smaller pilots they have already been tried out.  The GENIVI Alliance is working on a connected vehicle pilot project with NCAM aimed at reducing traffic and improving pedestrian safety. GENIVI is developing open software that will send alerts to drivers for upcoming bus stops, crosswalks, changes in speed limits and traffic congestion based on local data. The pilot project will be in approximately 100 vehicles monitored by the City of Las Vegas and RTC.  With all the projects, the potential for duplicative and wasteful data collection is there, but it’s a problem that Langford said has not happened with the pilots.  “There’s a perception of overlap but there isn’t,” he said. “They all contribute to making our roads more efficient.”  But, he said, overlap could eventually happen internally. Langford said one of the big projects they are working on is a common data exchange. Having multiple devices in a single vehicle is not efficient.  “That’s an incredible waste of hardware when you multiply it by thousands,” he said.  Las Vegas and Southern Nevada work so well for these types of pilots partially because of the way the governmental departments deal with traffic regionally. RTC is a one-stop shop for startups and companies with ideas to improve traffic, wheras going to other cities might mean talking with a dozen departments, according to Hoeft. NCAM — which describes its work as being the contact point for industry, government and academia to bring together police, standards and tech that includes electric, connected and autonomous vehicles and other infrastructure — is also a boon for the regional government.  “The collaboration cuts out a lot of the lost of momentum,\" Hoeft said.  Recent legislation has empowered RTC even more for now and the future. RTC now has authority to utilize public-private partnerships or the State Infrastructure Banks as a funding source and better positions RTC to get federal funding. Ideally, even with all these car-focused pilots, Hoeft said they are working on public transit and projects like bike shares. Indeed, one of the recent bills passed was to explore a light rail system, faster buses and a streetcar for Las Vegas.  “You shouldn’t have to necessarily rely on your vehicle,” Hoeft said."},{"url":"https://www.enotrans.org/article/republicans-democrats-diverging-av-legislation/","title":"Republicans and Democrats Diverging on AV Legislation - Eno Transportation Weekly (press release) (subscription)","short_content":"In the last few months, the House and Senate have been crafting legislation to accelerate the development of automated vehicles (AVs) by reducing regulatory barriers at the federal and state levels.\nThe proposed LEAD’R Act would entirely preempt states from enacting motor vehicle standards around highly automated vehicles (HAVs), defined by the Society of Automotive Engineers as AV levels 3-5.\nClassification System for Vehicle Levels of AutomationCurrently, federal law prevents states from passing motor vehicle standards that conflict with existing Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS).\nThis was written with the understanding that vehicles will inevitably – and frequently – cross state lines, and that state-specific motor vehicle standards would significantly impede interstate commerce.\n“The bills before us today represent policy through exemption and preemption [rather than setting safety standards],” she said.","content":"June 29, 2017    Self-driving cars seemed to be the one thing that everyone on the Hill could get behind. Politicians on both sides of the aisle praised the new technology for its potential to improve safety, reduce traffic, improve mobility, and deliver a host of other benefits.  But when it comes to actually legislating, nothing is truly bipartisan.  In the last few months, the House and Senate have been crafting legislation to accelerate the development of automated vehicles (AVs) by reducing regulatory barriers at the federal and state levels.  An announcement in February heralded a bipartisan effort between Senate Commerce Chairman John Thune (R-SD) and Sen. Gary Peters (D-MI), but the House Energy & Commerce Committee (E&C) remained rather quiet. Aside from rumors that E&C was working on a package of bills, little was published about the contents until earlier this month.  Then, on June 27, the Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection (DCCP) Subcommittee called on six witnesses to provide feedback on a package of 14 draft bills:  Mitch Bainwol, President and CEO, Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers (testimony)  President and CEO, Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers (testimony) John Bozzella, President and CEO, Global Automakers, (testimony)  President and CEO, Global Automakers, (testimony) Tim Day, Senior Vice President, Chamber Technology Engagement Center, U.S. Chamber of Commerce (testimony)  Senior Vice President, Chamber Technology Engagement Center, U.S. Chamber of Commerce (testimony) Alan Morrison, Lerner Family Associate Dean for Public Interest and Public Service Law, The George Washington University Law School (testimony)  Lerner Family Associate Dean for Public Interest and Public Service Law, The George Washington University Law School (testimony) David Strickland, Counsel, Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets and Partner, Venable LLP (testimony)  Counsel, Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets and Partner, Venable LLP (testimony) Will Wallace, Policy Analyst, Consumer Union (testimony)  Chairman Bob Latta (R-OH) presented the drafting process as inclusive, bipartisan, and still ongoing.  “I have always had an open door policy and I know we cannot get this right without real-world stakeholder input,” Latta said in his opening statement. “We will move forward under regular order, with multiple opportunities to improve upon the staff drafts. We will meet with anyone, and we are participating in bipartisan meetings.”  Latta positioned the hearing as a starting point for discussions around the bill, but Democrats railed against the legislation and its drafting process from the beginning.  “Although the minority was not involved in the development of these 14 bills, I would like to hold you, Mr. Chairman, to your commitment to work to make this a bipartisan effort,” said Rep. Frank Pallone (D-NJ), the full committee’s ranking member. The top democrat on the subcommittee, Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-IL), echoed this sentiment.  “The bills before us today represent policy through exemption and preemption [rather than direct rulemaking],” said Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-CA).  But one Democrat stood out. Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-MI) was bullish on the prospects of passing a bipartisan bill and urged Democrats to work with the majority. She said she wanted to help build “bipartisan consensus on what I hope will be a nonpartisan issue… an American issue.”  Preemption  “If states created 50 mini-NHTSAs [to regulate AVs]… it would be the undoing of our auto industry.” -David Strickland  Continuing 241 years of a proud American tradition, the fiercest arguments over the draft bills revolved around states’ rights and federal overreach.  The proposed LEAD’R Act would entirely preempt states from enacting motor vehicle standards around highly automated vehicles (HAVs), defined by the Society of Automotive Engineers as AV levels 3-5.  Classification System for Vehicle Levels of Automation  Currently, federal law prevents states from passing motor vehicle standards that conflict with existing Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS). This was written with the understanding that vehicles will inevitably – and frequently – cross state lines, and that state-specific motor vehicle standards would significantly impede interstate commerce.  While LEAD’R preempts states from enacting any policies that restrict the operation of private HAVs in their state, it concedes that states can establish standards around vehicles that the state or its political subdivisions purchase.  However, Democrats expressed concern that the current lack of federal standards – coupled with NHTSA’s expressed intent to wait until the technology matures – would leave states powerless to ensure that the AVs being operated in their borders are safe.  Democrats called on Professor Alan Morrison, a professor at George Washington University Law School. In his opening statement, Morrison indicated that he “knew very little about these issues” until six months ago, when he was asked to organize and moderate a conference on the legal landscape around AVs.  Perplexingly, he also admitted to having limited knowledge of the issues at hand: “I am not an engineer or a safety expert, nor do I have any detailed knowledge of the specifics of the relevant Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) that NHTSA has issued.”  Nevertheless, Morrison was the most aggressive witness on the panel, frequently cutting into both questions from Members and answers from witnesses.  But even if NHTSA could be considered an amateur in regulating advanced driving technologies, states themselves would be absolutely unaware of them. The traditional role of states has always been to oversee the licensing of drivers, vehicle registration, licensing, and road maintenance – not the actual design or performance of vehicles.  Already, states are signaling that they face significant staffing and funding challenges in their efforts to regulate AVs. California, for example, has long been the focal point for AV development – but has been rushing to keep up with the number of companies testing AVs in its state (as of June 27, 37 are now testing). Its initial laws required manufacturers to submit a payment of $150 to accompany applications for one year permits and renewals, but recently-proposed regulations would increase the fee to $3,600 “to allow the department to recover all of its reasonably incurred costs.”  But, for some Democrats – and especially Californian Democrats – this was not an effective argument.  “I just want to make sure that as we work on a policy framework that allows for the deployment of AVs, we need to make sure that states retain their traditional ability to keep their roadways and residents safe,” said Matsui. She asked the panel whether they agreed that states should have the ability to enforce safety through  “What about localities? Should any locality have the ability to say… [AVs] cannot be permitted within the streets on our towns, or near schools?” asked Morrison. “I would call that a traffic law.”  Strickland rebutted, “I think that the LEAD’R Act is taking the right approach… frankly, industry looks for regulatory certainty.”  Nevertheless, a new trend is emerging in state AV laws. Many states, such as Colorado and Texas, are no longer attempting to regulate the technology itself, but instead rely upon manufacturers to ensure the vehicles are safe before putting them on the road. States are recognizing that their resources are not only limited, but that their staff is not equipped or trained to analyze complex computer systems and advanced sensor technologies.  Exemption  Currently NHTSA can issue exemptions for testing up to 2,500 vehicles that do not comply with FMVSS, but are at the same or greater level of safety than compliant vehicles. Since AV developers are planning to develop vehicles that do not need components traditionally designed with human drivers in mind, a number of the bills propose expanding NHTSA’s exemption authority – including raising the cap to 100,000.  The reason this is important to manufacturers is that it takes billions – if not trillions – of miles to determine the safety of AV software. Most groups are using a threefold approach of public road testing, computer simulations, and test sites to evaluate and improve their AVs in a variety of situations.  This generated concern among Democrats and their witnesses, Wallace and Morrison, who suggested that this would allow vehicles on public roads without sufficient safeguards for consumers.  Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-CA) argued that the bills fell short of establishing standards that would ensure AVs on the road were safe. “The bills before us today represent policy through exemption and preemption [rather than setting safety standards],” she said.  With automakers and tech firms planning aggressive expansions of their testing operations – including Uber, Lyft, and Waymo’s intentions to operate AV fleets – Strickland argued that it is absolutely essential for the exemption cap to be raised.  “The bottom line is that NHTSA lives on data… having the ability to test 2,500 vehicles over 2 years is a horrible limitation,” said Strickland, referencing his prior experience as a NHTSA administrator.  Strickland recommended tweaking the language of the ROAD, EXEMPT, and MORE Acts to ensure that exempted vehicles are subject to the existing test to ensure that they are as safe or safer than compliant vehicles – as required under 49 U.S.C. §30113(b)(3)(B)(ii).  The McKinley Corner  No hearing on AVs is complete without the gentleman from West Virginia, Rep. David McKinley (R-WV).  McKinley – who, lest you forget, is one of only two engineers in Congress and does not believe in the potential of AVs “one iota” – posed an important question that has been frequently asked by consumer safety groups, but rarely answered: if automakers are so concerned about safety, why have they resisted implementing life-saving technologies that are available now?  Bainwol responded that the primary obstacle to incorporating alcohol detection devices and automatic emergency braking (AEB) today is cost – and that AVs provide an opportunity to capitalize on market forces to advance safety technology.  But what might have been a productive conversation quickly devolved into suspicion. McKinley argued that the hype over AVs was likely more of a money grab by automakers than an effort to improve affordability of transportation – which, in effect, could price a lot of consumers out of car ownership.  He asked the panel whether they planned to ask the federal government for subsidies to help consumers buy their prohibitively expensive automobiles.  The panel was dumbfounded.  “I… haven’t seen any indication of that,” responded Bainwol.  Next Steps  In a discussion with reporters afterwards, Latta and Dingell discussed next steps for advancing the legislation.  Following a series of questions about Democratic opposition to the draft bills, Dingell remained bullish on the prospect of eventually garnering Democratic support. She pushed back against questions about Democrats being left out of the process, suggesting that the draft bills should instead be called “working text.”  “You all are approaching this like they’re not going to come on board. They’re asking questions, raising their issues, but every person who spoke today talked about wanting to work together and getting this figured out,” said Dingell.  A reporter asked whether the subcommittee was considering legislation that would serve as a middle point between exemptions and establishing FMVSS – perhaps something like a self-certification or AV classification process.  Dingell said “we’re talking about it, trying to figure it out.”  (Asst. Ed. Note: In a recent report, Beyond Speculation, the Eno Center for Transportation recommended establishing an AV certification system based on SAE levels of automation that falls along these lines.)  Certification Levels for Automated Driving Systems (ADS)  “Again, what we have to still look at is that this technology is still emerging. We don’t want to pick winners and losers,” said Latta.  “What we’d really like to do is [have a markup] by, say, the end of July,” Latta said. “And again, we’ve got to keep moving because this technology is moving with it – or away from us, you might say. So we’d really like to see this moving forward in the next month.”"},{"url":"http://santamariatimes.com/opinion/letters/reforms-good-for-business-middle-class-nuclear-power-clean-waste/article_ee95df85-5a44-5fe7-bc3b-e43cbba906c9.html","title":"Reforms good for business, middle class; Nuclear power clean, waste stored - Santa Maria Times (subscription)","short_content":"Already a subscriber?\nClick on the button below to set up your account or log in if you already have one.","content":"Already a subscriber?

The European Commission's action mainly aims at ensuring cooperation between the different stakeholders from all EU Member States, and at preventing that the development of CAD leads to a fragmented internal market in the context of its Digital Single Market strategy.  The European Commission has not yet proposed any legislative evolution of the legal framework relating to CAD vehicles. However, it has set up a dedicated working group which has prepared preliminary recommendations on the need to work on legislative changes in the short term. It concluded that:  EU Directives on liability for defective products (85/374/EEC) and on motor insurance (2005/14/EC) are sufficient for upcoming automated systems;  There is no need for harmonisation on testing requirements at this stage (the Vienna and Geneva conventions are sufficient for testing as long as there is a driver/operator);  There is a need to clarify liability relating to CAD data storage and to create a mechanism to regulate the access to the data;  The development of CAD makes the 2010 Directive on Intelligent Transport Systems (2010/40/EU) more relevant and could be used as the basis to adopt a coherent set of rules at EU level in order to create a single market for CAD vehicles.  By Mathieu Relange, Associate, Brussels  Belgium  The driverless car does not exist yet, at least in current Belgian legislation, as there is no legal qualification for what could possibly be considered to be an 'autonomous vehicle'.  The most significant obstacle however is not the need for a definition of an autonomous vehicle, but the legal requirement that all vehicles must have a driver (article 8.1 of the Belgian Highway Code). The automotive industry has not been standing still however, and has already been performing tests on Belgian roads. The Ministry of Mobility has been receptive to this, and to offer an encouraging framework for pilot projects has produced a Code of Good Practice containing recommendations to companies developing such technology.  Another major issue with regard to driverless cars concerns liability on the part of the driver or the car manufacturer. In the case of driver liability, the relevant provisions contain a specific reference to a human person (articles 1382 and 1383 of the Belgian Civil Code). The same applies for recourse for indirect liability (goods under custody – article 1384 of the Belgian Civil Code), as the human behind the wheel would still be held responsible for an act committed by the car.  Liability on the part of the car manufacturer may be civil or even criminal. The car manufacturer is liable for unsafe products that it has made available to the public (article IX.2 of the Belgian Economic Code). In this regard, not only the company may be prosecuted, but also its directors. From a civil liability perspective, a car manufacturer may also be liable, on a no-fault basis, for damage caused by a manufacturing defect (article 1 of the Belgian Product Liability Act of 25 February 1991).  Czech Republic  Smart Cars and Personal Data  A growing trend towards autonomous vehicles is emerging in the automotive industry. However, the full scale deployment of SAE level 5 (completely autonomous) vehicles on roads, legally speaking, is currently not possible due to the limitations set out by the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, to which 75 countries, including the Czech Republic, are parties. The Vienna Convention specifically requires the driver to be able to control his vehicle at all times so as to be able to exercise due and proper care, and at all times to be in a position to perform all manoeuvres required of him.  When comparing the progress in autonomous driving technology with the development of the legislation governing such technology, it is apparent that the legislation will soon have to adopt many changes in order to catch up.  In our article we focus on the state of the legislation on personal data processing, as the Czech Data Protection Agency has in the past released opinions with respect to video recording systems, unmanned aircrafts and dashboard cameras that are used for the processing of personal data by autonomous vehicles.  However, changes can be expected even in this field of law as the date of the General Data Protection Regulation's introduction is rapidly approaching, and talks of requiring ‘black-boxes’ and other gadgets which process personal data inside autonomous vehicles for safety and investigation reasons are surfacing.  Denmark  New Danish rules allowing pilot projects with autonomous vehicles  In May 2017, the Danish parliament passed the necessary changes to the Danish Road Traffic Act making it possible to conduct pilot projects with autonomous vehicles on public roads. A specific pilot project may only be conducted with an approved vehicle, the entire project must be assessed by a certified assessor to make sure the project is safe, and the project must also be pre-approved by the Ministry of Transport in order for a project license to be granted.  Only projects with vehicles up to SAE level 4 (high automation) will be approved. Level 4 is an autonomous vehicle that can drive by itself without a driver present but where a driver can take remote control, and the approval will only cover specific roads in a specific area and within a certain time span. Projects with vehicles driven without the possibility of a takeover by a remote driver – ie fully autonomous cars - will not be allowed for now.  A project license will impose an obligation on the licensee to have insurance in place covering possible damages, and the licensee will have strict liability for all damages caused by the vehicle. The driver (present or remote) together with the licensee could also be held responsible for any criminal offence or violation of the Road Traffic Act committed during the test driving in accordance with normal liability rules.  Finland  Autonomous vehicles being tested on public roads and other developments in Finland  The first autonomous vehicles have been granted road traffic testing permits in Finland and they are now being tested on public roads. These vehicles are able to follow a pre-programmed route and avoid collisions with sudden obstacles without input from the driver.  However, the vehicles currently require the lane markings or sides of the road to be visible and this is considered quite a challenge in the arctic climate of Finland! Autonomous vehicles are part of several extensive development projects ongoing or planned for the near future in Finland relating to the automotive and transport sector.  These projects include major planned changes affecting the nationwide traffic infrastructure as well as significant amendments to the regulations concerning passenger transport. Our Helsinki office has for example advised the Finnish Ministry of Transport and Communications as well as the capital's metro and tram operator, Helsinki City Transport (HKL), relating to these changes as well as several private entities being affected by the developments.  France  France is expecting positive legislative developments this year regarding autonomous vehicles. Indeed, the new French President Emmanuel Macron promised during his campaign to improve the regulatory framework necessary for the development of autonomous cars.  A report issued in February 2017 by the Ministry of the Interior and the Secretary of State for Transport highlighted the fact that France is falling behind other countries and proposed 21 recommendations to build a strong government policy in favor of the deployment of autonomous vehicles. In particular, this report expresses the political willingness to amend the French Road Traffic Code to allow autonomous cars to circulate on public roads, to adapt provisions governing liability in case of accident and to resolve ethical issues related to inevitable accidents. Furthermore, the Decree dated August 3th, 2016 authorising the testing of autonomous cars on public roads should be ratified by the French Parliament in the coming months. Finally, the French Data Privacy agency (CNIL) is currently working on data protection aspects.  In other respects, the state authorities of France and Germany concluded a letter of intent in February for the implementation of an itinerary between Metz and the Sarre for the testing of autonomous vehicles. This would be the first international testing site in Europe and would be open to all automotive suppliers. The aim is to test the interoperability of the various technologies dedicated to communication of data between vehicles. France and Germany intend to remain one step ahead in the global competition surrounding autonomous vehicle technology.  By Eric Wallenbrock, Senior Counsel, Lyon  Germany  With the objective of creating legal certainty for both manufacturers and users of automated driving systems, the German Parliament has passed an amendment of the German Road Traffic Act which entered into force on 21 June 2017. The key amendments can be summarised as follows:  The operation of a vehicle by means of automated driving functions (as legally defined in the amended Act) is allowed, if the function is used as intended  The driver is allowed to turn his attention away from traffic events and vehicle operation if he maintains his perceptiveness so that he can immediately resume control over the vehicle if the automated system requires him to do so if he realises, or due to obvious circumstances must realise, that the requirements for the intended use of the automated system no longer exist.  Vehicles with automated systems will record data on whether the vehicle was steered by the driver or the automated system, whether the system required the driver to take over the driving process and whether the system experienced a malfunction.  The amendments exclusively concern the road traffic law and therefore the use of automated vehicles on public roads in Germany. They do not cover the type approval law which is mainly governed by international and European law.  Italy  In Italy despite much interest in autonomous driving, Italian legislation is far from allowing and regulating this new technology.  Article 46 of the Italian Highway Code establishes that: \"For the purpose of this Code, vehicles are all kinds of motor vehicles driven on the streets by a human driver\". Accordingly, a vehicle with a high automation (SAE 4 level) or fully automation (SAE 5 level) driving system would not be permitted circulate on Italian streets.  From a civil law perspective, art. 2054 of Italian Civil Code provides that the operator of a vehicle is liable for the damage caused to persons or to property by operation of the vehicle unless he proves that he did all that was possible in order to avoid the damage.  The operator of a fully autonomous vehicle however cannot avoid any damage that the vehicle could cause as he could be considered a kind of passenger. But if he had the chance to deactivate the autonomous driving system and hence to avoid the damage, he could be considered accountable for this choice according to the above article.  The lawmaker is currently discussing some possible reforms to the Highway Code, and this could be the occasion to permit and regulate the autonomous driving and connected vehicles.  Netherlands  Autonomous transportation core topic for policy on traffic  Autonomous transportation remains a core topic for the Netherlands policy on traffic. It was recently mentioned as one of the focal points in the annual report of the Ministry of Infrastructure and Environment, published on 17 May 2017. Autonomous transportation is part of the wider theme of Green & Smart mobility, as formulated by the (informal) Environment and Transport Council. Several highlights in this area were mentioned in the annual report, most importantly the declaration of Amsterdam, a joint European agenda intended to stimulate innovation in the field of green and smart mobility and to address related topics such as privacy and security.  The Netherlands has also focused on the topic of connected and autonomous transportation during its recent EU presidency.  Previously, on a national level a broader outline was presented to the lower house of parliament setting out the requirements to make the regulations and infrastructure future-proof. The general note, however, was made that in order to create effective policies, Europe-wide measures would be required. Therefore the focus is very much on the declaration of Amsterdam and subsequent developments.  By Roelien van Neck, Partner, The Hague  Poland  Public consultation of the Bill on Electro-mobility and Alternative Fuels dated 26 April 2017 (the \"Bill'') has now been completed. The Bill provides a definition of 'autonomous vehicle', and a legal framework for testing autonomous vehicles on public roads in Poland.  'Autonomous vehicle'  Under the Bill, an autonomous vehicle is an electric vehicle which is equipped with technology and systems which control the vehicle's movement and allow the vehicle to drive without any driver interaction.  Permit for testing autonomous vehicles  To obtain a permit the autonomous vehicle testing organiser must submit a formal written application to the appropriate road authority. The application must meet all formal and legal requirements provided by the Bill, including all required attachments.  Test vehicle organiser obligations  According to the Bill, the test vehicle organiser will be obliged to:  Cooperate with the local police to ensure that safety requirements are met during the tests  Ensure that an individual with a driving license is inside the test vehicle during the tests  Inform the public about the tests and the proposed test vehicle route  In cooperation with the local road authority, prepare special road signs informing road users about the autonomous vehicle testing.  Spain  Recently, the head of the Directorate General of Traffic (DGT), Gregorio Serrano, announced that the DGT will work with the relevant authorities on a so-called '21st century Traffic Act' which will regulate the driverless cars regime in detail.  Until now, no specific laws concerning this have been enacted in Spain: autonomous vehicles are currently governed by the broader regulatory framework that is applicable to vehicles. According to Mr Serrano, this should change, as Spain is a frontrunner in technology and innovation and should therefore be at the forefront of automotive vehicle regulations, ensuring that their implementation meets all security standards.  It must be noted that despite not being regulated, Spain has occupied an advantageous position compared to other countries up until very recently. This is because the country has not ratified the United Nations Vienna Convention on Road Traffic (1968), which expressly required, until March 2016, the presence of a driver in vehicles. This has allowed the earlier testing of autonomous cars on Spanish roads to be open to the public, and has enabled Spain to become a \"test country\", ahead of other countries.  Mr Serrano's recent announcement represents a step forward in furthering Spain's already advantageous stance, placing the country in an even more strategic position with a view to laying the groundwork for the deployment of autonomous vehicles.  UK  The UK Government announced a new Automated and Electric Vehicles Bill as part of the Queen's Speech on 21 June 2017 with the stated intention of ensuring that the UK \"remains a world leader in new industries, including electric cars.\" The UK Government's previously proposed legislation in this field, the Vehicle, Technology and Aviation Bill, was dropped when Parliament was dissolved after the calling by Theresa May of the 2017 General Election. However, that previous Bill's core proposal of extending compulsory motor vehicle insurance to cover the use of automated vehicles has been carried forward into the new Bill. The fine details of the proposed new law is a matter for future consultation, although (based on previous discussions) it is reasonable to assume that the new law will seek to carve out exclusions to insurer liability in limited circumstances, including where an accident results from the automated vehicle owner making unauthorised modifications to the vehicle's operating system and/or failing to install required updates.  Further, the new Bill proposes to give the UK Government powers to require the installation of charge points for electric vehicles at motorway service areas and large fuel retailers, and to require a set of common technical and operational standards to ensure that charge points work seamlessly across the UK.  In general, the UK Government has expressed an intention to take a step-by-step approach to regulatory reform in this area, so as to ensure that regulatory changes match technological developments.  By Jonathan Speed, Partner, and Russell Williamson, Associate, London  Asia-Pacific  Australia  The National Transport Commission (NTC) and Austroads, with the support of all levels of Australian Government, has released Guidelines for Trials of Automated Vehicles in Australia. The NTC is an independent advisory body to advise government on transport reform. Austroads is the peak organisation of Australian transport and traffic agencies.  With the release of the Guidelines and the support of all State Transport Ministers, the path is now clear for genuine trials of autonomous vehicles on Australian roads. This is an exciting step on the path to the mass adoption of autonomous vehicles and an encouraging sign that Australia is keeping up with other developed countries in the adoption of autonomous vehicles.  At its heart any trials will still rely on the ability of each state to exempt the proposed conduct from existing rules. However, by releasing guidelines, NTC and Austroads have legitimised a way forward to enable and facilitate testing to begin in earnest.  Coupled with the decision of ANCAP recently that will require Autonomous Emergency Braking to obtain a 5 star safety rating it is clear that the progressive automation is not only coming, it's safer.  There is an explicit acknowledgement and contemplation in the guidelines that trials will differ and involve different types of automation, location technology and risks. It asks applicants to submit an application that contains and addresses (or explains why it doesn’t need to address) a range of criteria, including key management criteria, a clear safety management plan, suitable insurance and data collection/dissemination.  China  A grand and yet modest ambition – autonomous cars in China  Autonomous cars are now being tested in various cities in China. They are also much discussed in the media following Baidu's high profile announcement of its plan to challenge Google's leading position in the development of autonomous/driverless cars. What is the Chinese government doing to support the development of autonomous cars? What are the legal challenges which it is likely to face, as China puts more emphasis on its laws and regulations?  As with the previous 12th Five Year plan, China's 13th Five Year Plan highlights a number of key technologies for which significant developments are intended to be made, including in driverless cars. The ambition of China however is a modest one.  In the \"Mid- to Long Term Development Plan of the Automotive Industry\" issued by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology on 6 April 2017, in respect of autonomous cars, China expects the following:  By 2020, more than 50% of motor vehicles will be installed with Driver Assistance (DA), Partial Automation (PA) and Conditional Automation (CA);  By 2025, more than 80% of motor vehicles will be installed with DA, PA or CA; and  by 2025, cars with High Automation and Full Automation will begin to enter the automotive market.  One of the reasons of the measured pace proposed by the Chinese government is that the current Chinese legal and regulatory system does not address key legal issues arising from autonomous cars, including related traffic offences, liabilities (both criminal and civil), vehicle registration, and sharing of telematics information. There is currently limited national and industry standards on autonomous cars to guide the relevant manufacturers. The Chinese government is now plugging the gap by setting up a new subcommittee under the existing Automotive Standardisation Committee. The new subcommittee, the Connected Smart Automotive Subcommittee, will be responsible for developing national standards on technologies concerning sensors, autonomous assistance, autonomous driving and information services which directly relate to telematics information. Relevant government officials have also made it clear that all relevant laws and regulations will need to be updated as and when autonomous cars become widely available to the general public in China.  By Michelle Chan, Partner, Hong Kong, supported by Sven-Michael Werner, Partner, and Serena Du, Associate, Shanghai  Singapore  Singapore investing heavily into developing driverless technology  In the past year, a multitude of initiatives – both private and public – have been launched in Singapore, with the aim to make Singapore a leader in driverless technology. Among them is a recently announced joint venture between nuTonomy, the driverless vehicle developer which launched a test for driverless taxis last September, and French automobile giant Peugeot. In addition, public institutions have become involved: with the Nanyang Technical University and the Land Transport Authority (\"LTA\") developing a 1.8-hectare test circuit for autonomous vehicles (\"AVs\") which will simulate the environment of public roads for AVs enhancing the ability of AV technology to adapt to traffic conditions and follow traffic rules. LTA and the land systems engineering branch of ST Engineering have recently agreed to introduce a three-and-a-half year AV trial with the aim of having driverless busses transporting passengers along fixed routes, including the possibility of several driverless pods on the island of Sentosa which can be summoned via a smartphone.  Singapore's Parliament amended the Road Traffic Act (\"RTA\") in February of this year, setting different standards for AVs. This included allowing for AV trials to be conducted on public roads and exempting AVs, their operators and those in charge of said trials from existing standards of the RTA. The key provision of the RTA that no longer applies to AVs is the one making the human driver of the vehicle responsible for its safe use. In the debates leading up to these changes, public officials were very vocal about the potential AV technology has for Singapore and the potential benefits they offer, such as increasing fuel efficiency and decreasing road accidents. Regulation regarding AVs is still in its infancy as researchers and government assess the role AVs will realistically play in Singapore and where the hazards lie. Nonetheless, given the amount of investment by different groups in various industries to develop the technology, it's likely that AVs will eventually become an important part of the transportation infrastructure.  Middle East  UAE  The United Arab Emirates, and in particular the Emirate of Dubai being the futuristic city that it is, continue to welcome and encourage the dawn of autonomous vehicles.  The Dubai government aims to be the smartest city in the world and has committed in its Dubai Autonomous Transportation Strategy to have 25% of all transportation in Dubai be autonomous by 2030.  Dubai is evidently taking steps to achieve that goal as the Dubai Roads and Transport Authority has announced that they have entered into a contract for the supply of 200 autonomous Tesla cars to be used in their limousine service. Tesla expects to ship these cars into Dubai by July of this year.  With Tesla bringing its first fully autonomous cars to the UAE market this summer, and unofficial mentions of dedicated autonomous car lanes, the autonomous car industry is set to continue to grow in the UAE.  We expect to see further activity in the market as well as regulation from the UAE government on autonomous cars to aid its 2030 strategy."},{"url":"http://www.independent.ie/business/brexit/uk-deluded-over-plan-for-brexit-transitional-period-warns-hogan-36032932.html","title":"UK 'deluded' over plan for Brexit transitional period, warns Hogan - Independent.ie","short_content":"Ireland's EU Commissioner Phil Hogan said yesterday this country could be the \"biggest victim of this mess\" and accused the UK of \"high-level delusion\".\nThe British government will today publish a position paper suggesting that ministers will stick to their plan for a \"light touch\" customs border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.\n\"But if there is an appetite for a pragmatic and reasonable outcome to a free-trade agreement, well then membership of the customs union would make a significant contribution to this.\nOr it could be a new customs partnership that would avoid the need for a customs border.\nThe interim \"temporary\" customs union would allow for a \"smooth and orderly transfer to the new regime\", it added.","content":"Ireland's EU Commissioner Phil Hogan said yesterday this country could be the \"biggest victim of this mess\" and accused the UK of \"high-level delusion\".

The proliferation of autonomous vehicles has had this effect on a number of players across industries from computing, to data storage, to software and connectivity companies.  During this year’s Auto Tech Council – Innovation in Motion event in Milpitas, California, Arnold Meijer (pictured), strategic marketing manager at TomTom Maps, the veteran mapping and navigation software company, shared how his company is staying up to date with the latest auto tech trends.  “We acknowledge the fact that we need more information from vehicles, so we were one of the first to start collecting information from communities of drivers on the road,” Meijer told Jeff Frick (@JeffFrick), host of theCUBE, SiliconANGLE Media’s mobile livestreaming studio. (* Disclosure below.)  “Most recently, we’re also adapting to the change in the industry toward autonomous driving; we’re adapting our map data and our software products to support those use cases,” Meijer added.  Mapping technology interface changing for autonomous cars  The traditional notion of a map as a visual interface is changing for autonomous vehicle control into, essentially, a database of geographically relevant information, according to Meijer.  “Maps have traditionally been used by humans to interpret where you are by navigation systems to visually present how to adapt a route. … We’re going from maps to location information; the whole visual element is out of the discussion into something that adds to sensors,” Meijer said.  Moving beyond building the initial location information database, TomTom has plans to expand its coverage into new regions and new sensor inputs into its mapping system.  “Increasing the number of layers and partners that we work with, we’re looking to expand that. Also scalability for mapping … expanding that map database to more regions.

This justified sentiment, however, has been “diverted into an exceptionalistic extremism that knows no boundaries of behavior,” the songwriter pointed out.  ​As it gains strength, BDS is emerging as one of the most divisive movements across the global political landscape. In the past several years, some US churches, students’ and teachers’ organizations and high-level academics have made pledges to divest from Israeli businesses and institutions; on Saturday, the fast-growing Democratic Socialists of America, a party associated with former presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, passed a resolution endorsing the movement at its national convention in Chicago.  Meanwhile, the bipartisan Israel Anti-Boycott Act introduced into the US Senate in March, would make support for international boycotts against Israel a felony.  Proponents on both sides of the issue are running for the garrisons, preparing for political war.  \"On the altar of Zionism, they want to tear up the Constitution,\" Waters said, pointing to First Amendment free speech rights that would be \"scratched out\" if the Israel Anti-Boycott Act becomes law.  The American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) is “terrified” that public discourse will stray too far from the status quo of supporting Israel almost without question, Waters noted of the powerful Washington lobbyist group. Particularly, AIPAC and its kin are wary of word getting around about the “oppression” of Palestinians in occupied territories, the artist said. “If somebody suggests there might be an alternative narrative, they want them silenced.\"  On June 5, Waters wrote an open letter to Radiohead to protest that band’s crossing the BDS picket line earlier in the year to play a show in Tel Aviv. \"Today is the 50th anniversary of the occupation of Palestine by Israel,\" the bassist and songwriter wrote. \"Fifty years living under military occupation, 50 years for a people with no civil rights, 50 years of no recourse to the law, 50 years of apartheid.\"  The BDS picket line \"exists to shine a light on the predicament of the occupied people of Palestine, both in Palestine and those displaced abroad, and to promote equal civil rights for all the people living between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea no matter what their nationality, race or religion,\" Waters’ letter reads.  Another prominent pro-Israel lobby in Washington, the Jewish Community Relations Council (JCRC) of Greater Washington, released a video ahead of Waters’ shows in Washington over the weekend, criticizing the musician for “using music to divide people.”  ​JCRC executive director Ron Halber called Waters \"an embarrassment\" during an interview with the Washington Post published in a Saturday column. \"I advise him to stick to music and stop talking about things he knows nothing about,\" Halber said.  Benjamin Balthaser, a Jew who joined DSA last year, told the Intercept “the Israeli government says it represents all Jews in the world … I think it’s very important for the Jewish community to say, 'We don’t feel represented by an apartheid government. We don’t feel represented by a military occupation.'\"  Regarding the intersection of the BDS movement and pending legislation that would criminalize the boycott, the legendary musician said, “We’re arriving at a fundamental crunch point where your civil liberties are being attacked by what is essentially an agent of a foreign government.”  Tel Aviv to Waters: Wish you were here."},{"url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/21/technology/self-driving-cars-washington-congress.html","title":"As Self-Driving Cars Near, Washington Plays Catch-Up - New York Times","short_content":"Self-driving cars would obviate those problems, even if they would introduce new fears.\nIn the absence of federal guidance, many states have started developing their own laws for self-driving cars.\nMichigan passed a package of bills last year that made it easier for auto manufacturers to experiment with self-driving cars on public roads.\nAnd Florida passed a law that legalized truly self-driving cars, with no human operator behind the wheel.\nBut for now, as self-driving cars peek over the horizon and gridlock seizes Capitol Hill, lawmakers just seem happy to have found something — anything — to agree on.","content":"Self-driving cars would obviate those problems, even if they would introduce new fears. (One well-publicized accident, a fatal 2016 crash involving a Tesla that was set to “autopilot” mode by its owner, sparked worries among regulators, who later concluded that Tesla’s driver-assistance system was not to blame for the accident.)  Representative Debbie Dingell, a Michigan Democrat who supports the House’s self-driving car bill, told me that lawmakers had been prompted to act by concerns about economic competitiveness, in addition to the promise of safer roads.  “These vehicles are going to be developed, and I want to make sure we’re developing them in this country, not China, India or the European Union,” said Ms. Dingell, a former auto lobbyist and General Motors executive whose district includes the headquarters of Ford Motor Company. “The challenge for this country, period, is how we stay at the forefront of innovation and technology.”  While not yet commercially available, self-driving cars are being tested in several states, and semi-automated cars capable of piloting themselves on the highway, such as Tesla’s Model S, are already on the roads. Some experts predict it could be a decade or longer until cars are capable of full autonomy in every driving condition, but several major auto manufacturers, including Ford and Toyota, say they’re on track to release cars capable of limited autonomy within the next four years.  In the absence of federal guidance, many states have started developing their own laws for self-driving cars. California’s Department of Motor Vehicles recently released a series of proposed rules, and the state is beginning to modify its roads to make them easier for the sensors in autonomous vehicles to analyze. Michigan passed a package of bills last year that made it easier for auto manufacturers to experiment with self-driving cars on public roads. And Florida passed a law that legalized truly self-driving cars, with no human operator behind the wheel.  While engineers race to bring self-driving cars to market, Silicon Valley companies and Detroit automakers have been lobbying Congress for federal laws that would replace many of the existing state-by-state regulations and allow them to experiment more freely with new autonomous systems. Ford, Google, Uber, Lyft and Volvo have teamed up to form the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets, an industry group that has pressed for a clear set of national standards.  Regulating self-driving cars is a tricky balancing act. Crack down too hard, and you risk stalling the development of a potentially lifesaving technology. Go easy, and you risk letting unsafe vehicles onto public roads before they’re adequately tested. There are cybersecurity risks to address, too, since autonomous vehicles will be connected wirelessly to the internet and could be susceptible to hacking. The House bill would require manufacturers of new autonomous systems to submit security plans for their self-driving cars, as well as meet basic safety standards.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Many states have opted for a permissive stance on self-driving cars, hoping to land a piece of an emerging multibillion-dollar industry. Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, recently told a National Governors Association meeting that within 10 years he expected “almost all” new cars produced in the United States would be fully autonomous.  Photo  Making people comfortable with robotic chauffeurs, of course, is another matter. According to a poll conducted this year by AAA, 78 percent of drivers in the United States are afraid to ride in a self-driving car, and 54 percent would feel less safe sharing the road with one.  “People want to feel like they’re in control of their destiny,” said Elliot Katz, a lawyer at DLA Piper who works on self-driving car issues. Mr. Katz said federal regulation could help convince consumers that autonomous vehicles are safe.  “We need rules and regulations so that the driving public knows this isn’t just the Wild West,” he said.

Right now, the benefits of self-driving cars are clear and concrete — fewer traffic deaths, easier commutes, the ability to safely use your phone while you drive — while the costs remain largely theoretical. But experts have warned that the self-driving car revolution could usher in sweeping economic changes, including the displacement of millions of workers. Roughly 1.7 million Americans drive long-haul trucks for a living, and another 1.7 million people drive taxis, buses and other commercial vehicles. When autonomous vehicles render many of those jobs obsolete, politicians will have a much bigger set of problems to contend with.  “Governments have largely focused on the legality of automated driving,” said Bryant Walker Smith, an assistant professor at the University of South Carolina School of Law who focuses on autonomous driving. “They should also pay attention to the broader challenges and opportunities of automated driving — what it means for our lives, our governments, our land use, our cities, our social services, our jobs and how we live.”  The politics of autonomous driving will almost certainly become messier as self-driving cars edge closer to widespread use. There will be safety and security worries, intra-industry squabbles and backlash from driver unions concerned about job loss. The self-driving car could become a politically polarizing symbol, with some Americans cheering it as a technological miracle and others viewing it as a nanny-state intrusion into individual liberty. It’s not hard to imagine that one day a politician might run for office on a “Make America Drive Again” platform.  But for now, as self-driving cars peek over the horizon and gridlock seizes Capitol Hill, lawmakers just seem happy to have found something — anything — to agree on.  “It’s sexy, and that carries issues a long way,” Mr. Smith said of the self-driving car movement. “A hot, potentially even bipartisan subject can be more appealing than the mundane.”"},{"url":"http://wtvr.com/2017/07/18/driverless-car-testing-in-virginia/","title":"Driverless cars likely coming to Virginia interstates | WTVR.com - wtvr.com","short_content":"Please enable Javascript to watch this videoRICHMOND, Va. -- After a vote Wednesday in Richmond, wireless-connected and autonomous vehicles could soon drive alongside human operated vehicles on two Virginia interstates.\nThe Commonwealth Transportation board is set to approve a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT), federal researchers, and the companies that operate HOT lanes on Interstate 95 and 495.\nThe agreement would allow testing of wireless connected and driverless vehicles in I-95 and I-495 HOT lanes in Virginia.\nAccording to the United States Department of Transportation, \"connected vehicles enable safe, interoperable networked wireless communications among vehicles, the infrastructure, and passengers’ personal communications devices.\"\nThe Commonwealth Transportation Board is scheduled to vote on approval of the MOU at their meeting Wednesday.","content":"Please enable Javascript to watch this video  RICHMOND, Va. -- After a vote Wednesday in Richmond, wireless-connected and autonomous vehicles could soon drive alongside human operated vehicles on two Virginia interstates.

As the world’s biggest automobile manufacturers and tech companies invest in developing autonomous vehicles that can navigate without a human steering a wheel or pressing a pedal, some state officials are calling on lawmakers to put in place policies to address technologies they say could radically change transportation.  Nineteen states have passed laws regulating autonomous vehicles, and governors in three more states have set out policies through executive order. But New Mexico does not have any rules for such machines, leaving companies that might hope to put autonomous vehicles on the road in New Mexico with a host of tricky questions.  How do you insure such a vehicle and register it, for example?  Department of Transportation Secretary Tom Church said the governor has tasked him with developing policies on automated vehicles that legislators can take up during the coming lawmaking session early next year.  “By the time the industry hits us, even if we can participate in some of the test, we’ll have laws in place,” Church told reporters after a legislative hearing Tuesday afternoon at the Capitol.  During the hearing, Charles Remkes, manager of the department’s intelligent transportation systems program, depicted an industry that poses a range of regulatory questions while also offering the prospect of improving the flow and safety of traffic and the efficiency of transporting goods.  The federal government is responsible for regulating safety standards. But it is still up to states to decide how to register autonomous vehicles, inspect the machines and license drivers — if at all.  “In a lot of ways, we’re just now starting a conversation,” Remkes said.  Boosters see the industry not only as a force that New Mexico might eventually have to grapple with as technology changes and major auto companies from Ford to Nissan to Subaru invest in driverless vehicles. They also see the new technology as an opportunity for economic development.  “There’s a lot of activity going on and New Mexico is not part of it,” said Sen. James White, R-Albuquerque, who testified Tuesday about what he sees as a need for the state to prepare for driverless technology.  Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Transportation designated 10 proving grounds for testing autonomous vehicles, including several major roads in Texas’ biggest cities as well as a port of entry in El Paso. Meanwhile, Google has launched an autonomous car program in Phoenix.  Albuquerque Mayor Richard Berry issued a directive earlier this month calling on the municipal government in New Mexico’s largest city to support testing as well as pilot programs for self-driving vehicles. A firm in that city, TriLumina, is also working on technologies for the automated vehicle industry. But the policy still requires preapproval for any trips on public roads.  Changes in vehicle technology are coming, though, officials insisted.  Church said a test of what is known as connected vehicle technology may roll through New Mexico on Interstate 10 in the next few months. Such technology allows vehicles to communicate electronically with one another to improve navigation and operation.  Still, the very idea of self-driving cars gave some legislators pause.  “When,” Sen. John Arthur Smith, D-Deming, asked no one in particular, “does mankind’s brain become obsolete?”  ©2017 The Santa Fe New Mexican (Santa Fe, N.M.)

With concentrated growth coming at a time where mature markets are already making progress, technological advancements in the country are expected to occur at a faster rate. Consider that there are currently over 600 million smartphone users in China — many of whom have had smartphones as their first phones.  ‘Early adoption’ is less of a concern in emerging markets as new technologies have materialised at later stages of the development life-cycle. Though still in its infancy, the connected car is expected to progress at an accelerated pace.  Over half of the Chinese population is now online — that’s 731 million internet users. And perhaps more compelling is the fact that 95 per cent of those users access the internet via mobile devices. With the increasing number of mobile users, demand for in-car connectivity is expected to be stronger and more widespread.  A quick perusal of domestic vehicle infotainment options and it’s clear that in-vehicle connectivity and technology is increasingly important to Chinese buyers – 10-inch LED touch-screen interfaces, integrated GPS, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) – all technology that has only recently become available even in mature markets.  Of course, these advancements come at a cost to both the automaker and the buyer. In its annual Connected Car Report , Strategy&, a global strategy consulting firm, estimated that revenues related to in-vehicle connected services including vehicle management, entertainment, and navigation could double by 2022.  As part of the study, over half (51 per cent) of the 3,000 plus participants in online surveys and focus groups responded that connected functionality was an influencing factor in purchasing a vehicle — higher than price (46 per cent) and engine performance (46 per cent).  Beyond the consumer push for increased connectivity, the Chinese government has been supportive of the advancement of automotive technology as part of the ‘Made in China 2025’ initiative, providing incentives for domestic companies working towards new energy resources, increased connectivity, and autonomous driving.  As with any emerging technology, there are a number of barriers that could slow mass penetration and economies of scale for connected cars and ultimately, the future autonomous vehicle ecosystem in China. Newer functionality and capability take time to develop and bring to production, and could cause frustration for end users if not properly designed and tested.  Also, the greater concerns loom over cybersecurity threats and the potential behind the available data that increasingly connected vehicles hold. Much is yet to be determined when it comes to the related data liability and ownership.  Advancing technologies require significant investment from automakers to fully capture the digital potential in connected cars. Indeed, strategic partnerships within the automotive value chain will evolve to include other sectors and industries. The competitive landscape will not only grow, but proliferate to encompass stakeholders beyond traditional manufacturers.  Potential exists for tech giants such as Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent, which have the technical know-how related to mobile connectivity and services, to Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers in the areas of advanced driver assistance systems, in-vehicle electronic, and so on. As in the case of Silicon Valley, newer tech start-ups with niche connectivity solutions will be funded or acquired, creating a market ripe for an uptick in deals activity.  With the growth and rate of innovation already in the Chinese automotive market, there is little doubt that the potential related to connected cars is significant. Ultimately, technology and automotive companies will need to find synergies to effectively bring connected cars to the masses.  Automakers and tech service providers will have to develop sound strategies to ensure they are prepared for the next digital revolution… in vehicles. Connected cars – including autonomous driving, safety, entertainment, vehicle management, and mobility management – will likely drive the future of the automotive industry.  The Indian automotive market will not be an exception and looking at the increasing internet user in our country, vehicle connectivity will take off much earlier than expected and more connectivity will offer OEMs an added advantage to convince customers to buy their products.

In June, the Commission released a report that summarizes their findings. It takes a strong stance and answers many of the questions .","content":"Split second decisions made behind the wheel of a car can, in rare cases, result in the injury or death of passengers or bystanders. Up until now, humans faced those decisions. But as automated vehicles (AVs) take to the roads, they will inevitably face similar choices.  When a human driver is involved in an unavoidable crash, they usually get the benefit of the doubt that they acted in society’s best interest. However, AVs will have programmable code that could effectively predetermine the actions and outcome in a split second crash situation.  Experts constantly go back and forth on how AVs should react in such situations, and who should be responsible for overseeing the “decision-making” code. A new report from Germany takes the issue of AV ethics head on and provides clear guidelines for tough ethical situations. It also provides recommendations for how governments and private industry should approach them.  Over the past nine months, the German Federal Transport Ministry organized an Ethics Commission to examine some of the most complex aspects of the ethics that surround connected and automated vehicles. In June, the Commission released a report that summarizes their findings. It takes a strong stance and answers many of the questions we have about AVs here in the U.S.  The report lists 20 primary points related to ethics and AVs, some of which are obvious but essential to the ethics debate. For example:  The safety of human lives should always be the primary goal of AV systems  Designers and programmers should emphasize avoiding crashes altogether  AV developers have the responsibility to design the system to avoid security breaches  Technology and auto firms need to be transparent and proactively educate consumers and the general public about what their technology can and cannot do  Of these 20 points, three address some of the more nuanced ethics issues, and are relevant to the current AV policy debate in the Unites States.  The public sector is responsible for guaranteeing safety.  The German Ethics Commission states that the public sector’s role is to ensure that automated and connected vehicle technologies are safe. The driving systems “need official licensing and monitoring,” similar to what Eno recommended in a recent report, Beyond Speculation. The Commission emphasized that the company developing a car’s software system is liable for anything that goes wrong with it, as is already the case for product liability. In the report, “licensing” refers to what we call technology “certification” here in the U.S. This is necessary for the public sector to oversee and ensure the safety of these vehicles.  AV developers must clearly distinguish the responsible party in a “hot potato” situation.  Automated vehicles are organized into 6 different levels based on how much a computer or human is controlling the vehicle. Level 2 and 3 automated vehicle systems do most of the driving task, but rely on human drivers to take control in certain situations. In these cases, the human driver must either be constantly watching the road (in Level 2) or present in the driver seat (Level 3) and ready to take over control of the vehicle.  However, the amount of time before the system shifts control of the car back to the human (or vice versa) is not well defined. The Commission report states that the car must be designed so that it is clear and apparent which side is responsible for driving and what those responsibilities include.  For higher levels of automation (levels 4 and 5) there should be no need for quick shift from computer to human. And in emergency situations, the car must be able to bring itself to a “safe condition.”  The trolley dilemma does not apply to AVs.  The trolley dilemma arises when the AV system’s programmers make an explicit decision to save one (or more) human life over another. The debate on how to respond, either by saving the car passengers or minimizing risk to overall human life, has been a primary subject of debate over the past few years.  The Commission’s report puts this problem in context. It ultimately concludes that the scenarios in which an AV would have to make such a choice are so complex and unpredictable that there is no way for ethical decisions to be standardized in programming code or regulation.  Even if ethicists could come up with a definitive answer to the dilemma, it would be futile to program it. AV developers should instead focus all attention on avoiding crashes. In the rare instance where there is a crash with an unavoidable loss of life, an independent or governmental body should evaluate the situation and determine the lessons learned.  As we begin to rely more and more on technology in our vehicles, it is important that we carefully consider the implications of automating the driving task. Germany’s Ethics Commission concisely and thoughtfully addresses some of the most challenging ethical debates that have arisen so far. Here in the United States, we do not need to reinvent the ethical wheel – instead, we should take heed from countries such as Germany that are already sorting out these challenging issues."},{"url":"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEX-17-1964_en.htm","title":"Daily News 10 / 07 / 2017 - EU News","short_content":"Tibor Navracsics, Commissaire pour l'éducation, la culture, la jeunesse et le sport, a déclaré: «Je me réjouis du développement du corps européen de solidarité.\n: +32 229 58615; Sara Soumillion – Tel.\n: +32 229 56194; Barbara Ochotnicka – Tel.\n: +32 229 67083; Inga Höglund - Tel.\n: +32 229 50698)","content":"Corps européen de solidarité: emplois et stages sur la bonne voie  Six mois après le lancement du corps européen de solidarité par la Commission européenne et depuis le début de la sélection pour la participation à des projets de volontariat en mars 2017, le coup d'envoi à des milliers de placements (emplois et stages) est désormais donné.

The consultation aims to gather targeted input from stakeholders on ways to improve the functioning of the secondary market and more specifically on loan servicing activities by third parties and the transfer of loans away from the originating bank. The consultation also offers interested parties the occasion to give feedback on a possible new instrument, labelled 'accelerated loan security', aimed at increasing the protection of secured creditors from business borrowers' default to improve the functioning of the SMEs credit market. European Commission Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis, responsible for Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union, said: \"High level of NPLs in many Member States hold back economic growth and can be source of spill-over risks to the overall economy and financial system of the European Union. That's why our priority is to tackle NPLs. While there is no single silver bullet, the Commission is supporting the targeted work of Member States. One of the key areas where the EU can make a contribution is the development of secondary markets for distressed debt. If banks were able to off-load legacy assets from their balance sheet better via secondary markets for credit, they could use their managerial capacity more on evaluating new lending business.” Respondents are invited to provide evidence-based feedback and specific suggestions by 20 October 2017 through the online questionnaire. Further to this work, the Commission will also launch an impact assessment with the objective of considering a possible legislative initiative to strengthen the ability of secured creditors to recover value from secured loans to corporates and entrepreneurs.

This year, 37 student-teams competed as part of JA Europe’s flagship JA Company Programme, which gives them the opportunity to set up and run a real business.  King Philippe of Belgium, EU Commissioners Marianne Thyssen and Tibor Navracsics, Belgian Ministers Alexander De Croo and Willy Borsus, as well as foreign dignitaries and various business volunteers were among those who attended the stand exhibition of the student companies, all keen to show their support.Participants of the European Entrepreneurship Education Summit also came to see the students in action, both events being held simultaneously in Brussels.Estonia’s contestants Festera scooped the main award of the JA Europe Company of the Year Competition 2017. This award - presented before 700 people at the Gala Award Ceremony on 12 July - honours the student company that demonstrates the best approach to communication, teamwork, problem-solving, objective-setting, personnel management, product development, customer focus, marketing and financial results.Festera showcased an innovative business concept with a strong environmental angle that particularily impressed the jury. Their creation, the Festera biobox, is an indoor trash can that recycles organic waste. It can turn a household’s entire food waste output into humus in less than two months, thereby reducing a family’s ecological footprint by more than 5 percent.Barak Pridor, Managing Partner at Saban Ventures, an Israeli venture capital firm, was one of the 10 judges in the jury. He explained to The Brussels Times that initiatives and events like these go a long way in helping to bridge the gap between education and entrepreneurship in practice. He added that he was very impressed with the passion and entrepreneurial spirit shown by all the participating teams, and in particular also the enthusiasm and consideration by the students for wider social impacts and benefits that their projects could bring about, not only financial results.Caroline Jenner, CEO of JA Europe said that “this is where it is possible to truly see the R.O.I of entrepreneurship education. This is the “final exam” for competence, motivation and confidence. But it’s also where we see the impact of the learning environment on teachers, on mentors and on parents”.Last school year, the JA Company Programme counted over 300 000 participating students across 40 countries in Europe. Through the process of learning to run a company from top to bottom, JA Company Programme students create and market real products and services. The success of the programme is largely down to the wide support from business volunteers, acting as mentors, offering expert advice to the students.

A recent survey from Dutch bank ING has pegged the year 2035 as the point when battery-powered cars will slay the gasoline engine for good.  Sales of electric vehicles have been slowly growing in Europe and the US, and are surging in China—in 2016, China registered as many as 352,000 new e-cars, compared to only 159,000 registered in the US during the same time period.  All over the world, though, buyers have been put off of electric cars by three distinct problems: limited range on a single battery charge, underdeveloped charging infrastructure, and the higher cost of electric models. Government incentives have persuaded many buyers to go electric, but when these incentives are removed—as seen recently with Tesla’s April sales slump in Hong Kong—then it currently makes more sense for most people to buy a petrol car.  That’s all going to change fast, according to ING’s report. From 2020 onwards, ING analysts say, more efficient next-generation battery technology will put an end to range anxiety. Battery-pack costs will drop rapidly, closing the price gap between electric and internal combustion engines completely by 2028. When it comes to total cost of ownership (buying, maintaining, powering, etc.) they say that by 2024, a Volkswagen e-Golf should save its owner a total of €2.500 ($2,800) a year compared to a comparable petrol car.  Even though price parity will be achieved by 2028, ING predicts that it will take until 2035 until everyone who buys a new car will buy electric. This they say will be brought about by the cost of EV ownership dipping below that of traditional cars, a big range of electric models, and the global phase-out of the internal combustion engine all coming together to make gas-powered cars a thing of the past  Europe’s automakers are already in a race to launch electric or hybrid options—Volvo recently announced it would only make electric or hybrid vehicles from 2019 onwards. But their biggest challenge won’t be transitioning from traditional to electric powertrains: ING predicts that the biggest threat to the industry will be access to raw materials like lithium and graphite for battery production, as well as the need to expand production facilities.  EU automakers currently own 25% of the global internal combustion engine market, but a paltry 3% of current or planned battery production is in Europe. European carmakers are late to the game when it comes to innovating in the EV field, as they’re still enjoying a lucrative traditional car market, and are baulking at retooling factories to produce electric cars that right now they can’t sell in any great numbers.  Meanwhile China is going all out building battery factories, and the US, thanks mainly to Tesla, is making great strides. ING predicts that electric cars from China and the US could take a serious bite out of the European car market in just a few decades.

Toyota Motor could begin making electric vehicles in China as soon as 2019 under a plan currently being considered. At present, the automaker's green-car operations focus primarily on gasoline-electric hybrids, including plug-in hybrids that users can charge at home, and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. But the government in Beijing has different plans. Electric vehicles in China receive generous subsidies and tax incentives, as well preferential treatment when major cities hand out license plates.  The Japanese automaker already plans to phase out internal-combustion-engine vehicles almost entirely by 2050, and created an office to plan its electric-car strategy at the end of 2016. Now the company is boosting development efforts, drawing on battery technology honed while creating hybrids to hatch competitive electric offerings.  Rival Honda Motor, meanwhile, aims to have environmentally friendly cars including electric vehicles and hybrids make up two-thirds of sales by 2030. American makers have set similar targets for increasing green cars' presence.  End of an era  But it is European car companies that have led the pack so far in the shift to electric autos. Volvo Cars of Sweden announced in early July it would sell only electric or hybrid models starting in 2019, becoming the first major automaker to announce a specific plan for ditching conventional vehicles.  Certain governments have leaped on that trend as well. The U.K. said Wednesday it will ban the sale of new gasoline or diesel vehicles by 2040, and bar such autos from the roads entirely 10 years later. In addition, the country has earmarked roughly 3 billion pounds ($3.93 billion) to combat air pollution, including 255 million pounds to support regional governments' efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and pollution. Vehicles that do not meet air quality standards will be banned from or fined for driving in certain heavily polluted areas.  The Netherlands and Norway have also made moves toward banning gasoline- and diesel-burning vehicles starting in 2025. And a German legislative body last fall passed a resolution to ban the sale of gas and diesel vehicles by 2030 that, while not legally binding, bolsters momentum toward more concrete efforts. That country's Volkswagen aims for electric vehicles to make up 20-25% of group sales in 2025.  India aims to sell only electric cars by 2030, the government said in April, and China has announced similar initiatives. Japan hopes to have technologies including electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids account for 50-70% of vehicle sales by 2030, though the country's large contingent of manufacturers producing parts for conventional cars could make ambitious policy changes a challenge.  New normal  More than 750,000 new partially or fully electric cars were sold around the world in 2016, bringing the total number on the road to more than 2 million, according to the International Energy Agency. That total could climb as high as 20 million vehicles in 2020 and 70 million vehicles in 2025, the group predicts.  For now, subsidies help buyers make up the difference between the cost of conventional vehicles and pricier alternatives. But manufacturers of batteries and other key components are hard at work making those parts cheaper and more effective, meaning electric cars could soon have their own economic advantages.  As the transition from gas to electric advances, the fuel sector will need to adjust. Transport, including passenger cars, accounted for 65% of global oil consumption in 2014, according to Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. But \"in an extreme scenario where electric cars gained a [50%] market share [in Europe] over 10 years about a quarter of European gasoline demand could disappear,\" according to a report by Fitch Ratings.  Demand for electricity, on the other hand, will climb as greener vehicles take off. If all of Japan's passenger cars were replaced by electric vehicles, power consumption could increase 10%. Thus the government needs to secure power generation capacity in order to advance the shift toward electric cars.  The U.K., for its part, now generates more than 20% of its power from renewable sources such as wind. But increasing that figure further while meeting the country's large electricity needs will be a challenge, particularly as aging nuclear facilities that supply much of the U.K's power come up for replacement. Other countries must contend with similar considerations."},{"url":"http://www.constructiondive.com/news/az-developers-plan-11b-motorsports-complex/448011/","title":"AZ developers plan $1.1B motorsports complex - Construction Dive","short_content":"Dive Brief:Arizona developers have announced their plans to build a $1.1 billion mixed-use motorsports complex in Pinal County, AZ, located between Phoenix and Tucson, according to AZ Business Magazine.\nThe project, Attesa, will include two racetracks, a 300-room hotel, a conference center, an airstrip and residences, as well as retail and industrial space.\nDevelopers expect high-tech motorsports and transportation design companies to open up shop in the complex.\nStates and cities are currently laying the groundwork for self-driving and other high-tech cars to hit the roads one day.\nThat preparatory work includes equipping their roads with compatible equipment like sensors as well as building mock highways for testing.","content":"Dive Brief:  Arizona developers have announced their plans to build a $1.1 billion mixed-use motorsports complex in Pinal County, AZ, located between Phoenix and Tucson, according to AZ Business Magazine.  The project, Attesa, will include two racetracks, a 300-room hotel, a conference center, an airstrip and residences, as well as retail and industrial space. Developers expect high-tech motorsports and transportation design companies to open up shop in the complex.  A collaboration with electric car maker Lucid Motors, which is building a $700 million plant nearby, is also possible, says the Casa Grande Dispatch. Attesa is expected to generate 8,000 construction positions. Groundbreaking is scheduled for early 2018.  Dive Insight:  When it comes to drawing on the traffic from professional events other than the karting races planned for Attesa, developers will have to compete with the nearby Phoenix International Raceway, which hosts major auto racing series sponsored by NASCAR, IndyCar and other leading motorsports organizations.  The bigger opportunity, however, is likely that of Lucid and other groups to use the Attesa tracks as testing ground for electric cars and other automobile-related developments like connected and automated vehicle technology.  States and cities are currently laying the groundwork for self-driving and other high-tech cars to hit the roads one day. That preparatory work includes equipping their roads with compatible equipment like sensors as well as building mock highways for testing.  The Florida Turnpike, for example, earlier this month broke ground on a test track for vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication as the Florida Department of Transportation tests high-speed toll technology.  A U.S. House panel this month gave the self-driving car industry a boost when it passed the first-ever federal measure governing their use. The legislation would allow autonomous vehicle manufacturers to begin deploying their stock onto American roads after the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration establishes rules, a process that would take 18 months after the bill's passage.  The new law would override current rules prohibiting cars from operating without driver control requirements, but it would also mandate that manufacturers come up with a way to protect the internet-connected systems on which the cars run."},{"url":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/26/electric-cars-everything-you-need-to-know","title":"Electric cars: everything you need to know - The Guardian","short_content":"From how to charge them to whether they are really better for the environmentHow will I charge an electric car?\nMost mass market electric cars today have a range of 100-150 miles before the battery runs flat.\nSome of the top-end cars, such as Tesla’s electric sports cars, can run for 334 miles before needing a plug socket.\nMakers of electric cars sell their models with a warranty for the battery, which will lose capacity over time.\nAnalysts are expecting a 100-fold increase in the production of lithium, the key material in electric cars’ batteries.","content":"From how to charge them to whether they are really better for the environment  How will I charge an electric car?  The first generation of electric-car buyers have been people with homes where it is easy to plug one in. “The vast majority of Nissan Leaf customers are [families with] 2.4 children, mums and dads, with off-street parking,” said Gareth Dunsmore of Nissan Europe. “Tomorrow that won’t be the case.”  Dunsmore envisages charging points becoming ubiquitous at workplaces, and at shopping centres, railway stations, hotels and cinemas. For longer journeys, rapid chargers that can recharge a car’s battery in 30 minutes will increasingly proliferate across motorway service stations and at conventional refuelling stations.  For drivers living on terraced streets, the answers are not so simple but solutions are beginning to emerge. For example, Kensington and Chelsea council is running a trial with a UK energy company and German firm to add charging sockets to street lamps.    I’m worried about the battery running out – should I be?  Most mass market electric cars today have a range of 100-150 miles before the battery runs flat. Some of the top-end cars, such as Tesla’s electric sports cars, can run for 334 miles before needing a plug socket.  While that may not sound much compared to the 400-500 miles or more that a petrol or diesel car can manage before refilling, most car journeys in the UK would easily be accomplished in an electric car. Half of journeys are one to five miles; 38% are for five to 25 miles and only 2% are for 50 miles and more.  Of course, some people will need to go much further – and that’s where plug-in hybrids come in, using a petrol engine to run an electric motor after the battery runs out.  Improving battery technology is expected to extend even pure electric cars’ ranges to about 400 miles within a decade.  Are they cheaper?  Londoners in an electric car can already enter the congestion charge zone for free. If the government’s anti-pollution drive leads to more towns and cities imposing an air quality zone, that could lead to more tolls, from which electric cars are likely to be exempt.  In terms of upfront costs, electric cars are still clearly more expensive than conventional ones – but companies like Renault and Nissan are getting around that with deals where buyers lease the battery. For example, the UK’s best-selling electric, the Nissan Leaf, is £16,680 with the battery on lease for a monthly fee, rising to £21,680 if you buy the battery outright.  Electricity is certainly cheaper than petrol or diesel. Travelling 100 miles in an electric car will cost £3-£4 depending on energy tariffs, compared with £15 in a petrol car.  Affordability is a key issue. When Volvo announced all its new car launches would by electric or hybrid from 2019, it stressed that they would be premium models, ie expensive.  Jack Cousens of the AA said: “Buying a car is an important financial decision, and families on low incomes will need government assistance and incentives to make the change to electric vehicles.”  Don’t the batteries die after a few years?  Makers of electric cars sell their models with a warranty for the battery, which will lose capacity over time. In the case of the Nissan Leaf, it’s covered for five years or 60,000 miles, rising to eight years or 100,000 miles for the version with a bigger battery. But yes, eventually you will need to either buy a new battery – by which time their cost should have fallen – or sell the car on.  Electric cars have been around long enough in the UK for a second-hand battery market to be emerging. One energy company, Eaton, is already selling used electric batteries for reuse as household batteries.  Will my diesel car lose value?  Probably, yes. One car-buying website says bad headlines for diesels, which on average sell for £7,000 used, are causing prices to fall faster in value than before. Motorway.co.uk predicts that over the next year the average price of used diesel cars could fall as much as 15% compared to their current depreciation rate.  What happens to all the petrol stations?  There are 8,476 filling stations across the UK. Energy analysts Wood Mackenzie say they are closing at a rate of about 100 a year and, with the rise of an electrified fleet, there will probably be no more than 6,000 sites by 2035. Numbers will probably continue to fall, although some may be converted to fast-charging sites  Are they really better for climate change than conventional cars?  Yes, even with fossil fuels in the power mix. In the UK, 50% of power is now generated from low carbon sources, and with that share growing rapidly in the next decade, emissions from electric cars will fall too.  Where will all the material come from for the batteries?  Analysts are expecting a 100-fold increase in the production of lithium, the key material in electric cars’ batteries. Much of that will come from South America, particularly Chile and Bolivia, which claims to have 70% of the world’s lithium reserves. China and Australia also provide lithium."},{"url":"http://www.businessinsider.com/electric-cars-markets-prediction-future-europe-2017-7","title":"Electric cars might dominate European markets by 2035, according to a new report - Business Insider","short_content":"A new report, released by Dutch bank ING, predicts that electric vehicles (EVs) will become the new normal in Europe within just two decades.\nBetween 2017 and 2024, completely electric cars are expected to “become the rational choice for motorists in Europe,” the report said, as EV showroom prices fall due to cheaper batteries and EV ranges increasing.\nThe ING report said that the cost of owning EVs in Germany in 2024 would be similar to owning fossil fuel-powered cars.\nStanford University economist Tony Seba, who published a separate report on EVs, made a similar forecast for worldwide adoption.\n“The car industry faces an imminent technology disruption by AEVs [autonomous electric vehicles] in the early 2020s.","content":"A new report, released by Dutch bank ING, predicts that electric vehicles (EVs) will become the new normal in Europe within just two decades.  While that seems like slow progress, it’s actually relatively progressive when compared to other reports.

Between 2017 and 2024, completely electric cars are expected to “become the rational choice for motorists in Europe,” the report said, as EV showroom prices fall due to cheaper batteries and EV ranges increasing. Charging infrastructure is also expected to become more widespread, in part due to government support.

Following are some of the possible challenges and consequences related to the decision:  ELECTRIC/HYBRID MARKET SHARE  123rf A key obstacle to making electric cars popular is the amount of time it takes to recharge, and a lack of charging stations.  In Europe, only 0.2 per cent of new passenger cars sold were fully electric in 2016 (1.3 per cent if hybrids are included).  READ MORE:  * UK to ban petrol-fuelled cars from 2040  * Dude, where's my Tesla?  * How do I refuel my car?  * US eye fuel efficiency standards  SUPPLIED Pressure is on the Tesla Model 3 electric cars to succeed.  THREAT TO JOBS  A combustion-engine car has 1400 components to build the motor, exhaust system and transmission. An electric vehicle's battery and electric motor has only 200 components, according to analysts at ING.  The average combustion engine takes about 3.5 hours to make, while the average transmission requires 2.7 hours of assembly. An electric motor takes about 1 hour to assemble, according to consultants AlixPartners.  SUPPLIED Generation EQ concept is our first look at Mercedes-Benz's new range of pure-electric production cars.  German auto industry association VDA has said a ban of combustion engined vehicles in 2030 would threaten more than 600,000 German industrial jobs, of which 436,000 are at car companies and suppliers.  In Europe, there are about 126 plants making combustion engines, employing 112,000 people (66,000 making powertrain, 46,000 making transmissions). The largest engine plant in Europe is Volkswagen's factory in Kassel.  The switch to hybrid and electric cars will create 25,000 new jobs for carmakers between 2015 and 2030, consultants Alix Partners said in their Global Automotive Outlook study for 2017.  Plug-in hybrid vehicles will help protect jobs in the short run since they combine electric and combustion engine technology. A hybrid car takes 50 per cent more time, or up to 9 hours longer, to make than cars with only a combustion engine.  TIPPING POINT  60 per cent of the cost of electric cars are in the battery. Costs have been prohibitive but are falling rapidly. Average battery costs have come down from over US$1000 (NZ$1331) per kilowatt hour in 2010, to around US$227 (NZ$302) in 2016 ,according to analysts at Barclays.  The \"tipping point\" when the cost of battery electric vehicles will reach parity with combustion engined equivalents will come when batteries reach a cost of US$100 per kilowatt hour. This will happen between 2020 and 2030, Barclays analysts say.  By 2025 the total cost of ownership between electric and combustion will reach parity (once taxes, fuel costs etc are included) - this time frame being brought forward if diesel gets higher taxation, analysts say.  As a result, Europe could become a 100 per cent pure battery electric vehicle market by 2035, according to ING.  INVESTMENT  A key obstacle to making electric cars popular is the amount of time it takes to recharge, and a lack of charging stations.  London needs to spend €10 billion (NZ$15.6 billion) to get charging infrastructure to a level where retail buyers can practically own an electric car, AlixPartners said. Almost none of that spending has been earmarked so far.  BRITAIN'S BAN, A CHALLENGE FOR GERMANY?  In 2016, Britain was the largest single export market for German manufacturers world-wide. (Fewer cars are imported to China and US because German carmakers already have factories in those markets). They sold 800,000 new cars there, or 20 per cent of their overall global exports.  - Reuters"},{"url":"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4091384-texas-instruments-auto-segment-strong","title":"Texas Instruments: The Auto Segment Is Strong - Seeking Alpha","short_content":"I already wrote about the company’s efforts in the field, and Q2 results demonstrated the current conditions are more than favorable for Texas Instruments.\nTexas Instruments and the auto industryTexas Instruments has solid exposure to the automotive segment (the details can be found in my previous article), and the results of Q2 look inspiring.\nThe company claims the demand in the auto market will continue to strengthen and the industrial segment will remain strong.\nDCF updateIn light of solid Q2 results, I updated my DCF model which I used previously to value Texas Instruments.\nTXN has a solid position in the auto industry, which was confirmed by decent Q2 results that were driven by the auto segment.","content":"Texas Instruments (TXN) is one of the tech stocks that is heavily involved in developing tech products for cars. I already wrote about the company’s efforts in the field, and Q2 results demonstrated the current conditions are more than favorable for Texas Instruments.  The auto market  The auto industry is changing rapidly along with the development of new technologies, and, as a result, cars are becoming more “connected.” Hence, it is estimated that by 2020, about 250 million connected vehicles will be on the road, “enabling new in-vehicle services and automated driving capabilities.” PWC claims the overall connected car market will grow at a 29% CAGR from now to 2020, reaching the size of 113 billion EUR.  As a result, many tech corporations aim to get involved in the market as the propspects are encouraging. Thus, Intel (INTC) bought Mobileye, the provider of ADAS and mapping solutions, to get direct exposure to the automotive market. Microsoft (MSFT) joined forces with Baidu (BIDU) to develop autonomous driving solutions. Nvidia (NVDA) powers most infotainment systems in the modern cars, also providing supercomputers for self driving.  Texas Instruments and the auto industry  Texas Instruments has solid exposure to the automotive segment (the details can be found in my previous article), and the results of Q2 look inspiring.  The corporation beat estimates on EPS by $0.07 and on revenue by $120 million, which represented about 13% growth year over year. One of the main drivers of success was the strong demand in the auto segment. Last year, 51% of the corporation’s revenue was generated by the automotive and industrial segments, with 18% generated directly by the former. This year the percentage is claimed to be even bigger.  We’ve got five sectors inside of automotive that we are in investing in. So that includes infotainment safety systems, ADAS or advance driver assist systems, power train, which includes EV and hybrid and body electronics and lighting. So we are seeing good growth across those comms vectors that sit inside of the automotive market.  Another positive takeaway from earnings is the fact that the margins are growing: gross margin increased from 61% in Q2 2016 to 64% in Q2 2017, operating margin rose from 35% to 40%. A possible explanation here is the increasing portion of auto revenue in total sales. Moreover, the auto market is likely to enable TI to set premium prices. TI’s management explains this:  So, our gross margins in second quarter of ’17 ended at 64.3% and that was 300 basis points higher than in the same quarter last year. And as you reflect the quality of our product portfolio, as we continue to focus on automotive and industrial, but also the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy and as you know, we have the unique advantage of having 300 millimeter factory that at the chip level provides 40% cost advantage.  The future outlook also seems to be positive for TXN. The company claims the demand in the auto market will continue to strengthen and the industrial segment will remain strong. The management forecasts earnings to be between $1.04 and $1.18 per share and revenue between $3.74 billion and $4.06 billion in Q3, which is higher than analysts’ average expectations. As a result, the stock price soared by 3% from $81 to $83.5 on July 26, albeit it gave out most gains during the trading session.  Other chip makers  The automotive segment also enables other semiconductor companies to show good results. For instance, Microchip Technology (MCHP) increased its revenue by about 60% in fiscal Q4 2017, which was reported in May. The company claimed automotive is their “fastest-growing market,” and Semicast ranked Microchip as “the eighth-largest automotive semiconductor company.” Notably, TXN held the fifth position in the ranking with an estimated market share of 6.4% in 2016.  It is interesting to note MCHP’s stock responded to TXN’s earnings with an increase from $81 to $83, which shows the company is also likely to demonstrate better-than-expected results driven by the auto segment.  In addition, it is reported by The Street that “analog, mixed-signal and micro-controller chip peers are also doing well.” The list of peers includes Analog Devices (ADI), On Semiconductor Corp. (ON), and STMicroelectronics NV (STM).  DCF update  In light of solid Q2 results, I updated my DCF model which I used previously to value Texas Instruments. The estimated fair price range was $75-78 under the scenario which implied 8% revenue growth in 2017. Notably, the stock price dropped from $84 to the level of $76 at the end of June, which could be used as a moment to invest in the company. As for the current situation, the company is demonstrating much better performance than it had been expected, evident by the results of Q2. Therefore, I raise my price target for TXN.  The changes in the assumptions are as follows:  1. The growth in 2017 seems to follow the optimistic scenario, which assumed revenue would increase by 12% in 2017. Therefore, the average revenue growth over the horizon period is estimated to be on the level of 9.2%, up 0.2% compared to the previous assumption.  2. The effective tax rate is expected to remain on the level of 31% estimated by the management.  3. I also updated the WACC, incorporating more traditional approach.  The after-tax cost of debt is 1.3%, which is taken from the Q2 earnings call. The cost of equity capital (12.6%) is computed using CAPM, with 1.16 five-years average beta, a 2.3% risk-free rate, and 9% market premium. The WACC is, therefore, 12.2%.  4. In addition, the new levels of cash and debt on the balance of the corporation were taken into account.  As a result of the recalculations, the model shows the fair stock price is $93.2 under the base scenario, which assumes 12.8x EBITDA terminal value. The sensitivity analysis shows a range of possible outcomes that will be driven by actual results of the corporation in the coming years. In light of this, the fair price range is $90.3-96, which represents 10-17% upside potential.  Final words  Overall, as vehicles are becoming more and more technologically equipped, such semiconductor companies as Texas Instruments gain from the trend. TXN has a solid position in the auto industry, which was confirmed by decent Q2 results that were driven by the auto segment.  In light of the strong performance demonstrated by the company, I updated my DCF model. The fair price range is estimated to be $90.3-96, representing 10-17% upside potential."},{"url":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/13/electric-cars-to-account-for-all-new-vehicle-sales-in-europe-by-2035","title":"Electric cars to account for all new vehicle sales in Europe by 2035 - The Guardian","short_content":"France’s commitment last week to banning new petrol and diesel car sales by 2040 suggests it also thinks the roll-out of electric vehicles will be slower than ING’s report expects.\nBy 2024, the report’s authors forecast that in Germany the cost of ownership for an electric car – including buying and fuelling it – would be the same as a conventional petrol or diesel model.\nSwedish firm Volvo recently marked the beginning of this trend, saying it would only launch hybrid, plug-in hybrid or 100% electric cars from 2019.\n“Europe’s competitive advantage in internal combustion engine powertrains disappears with the shift to battery electric vehicles,” the report said.\n“The car industry faces an imminent technology disruption by AEVs [autonomous electric vehicles] in the early 2020s.","content":"Falling battery costs to drive sales but European carmakers will lose out to rivals in the US and Asia, forecasts Dutch bank  All new cars sold in Europe will be electric within less than two decades, driven by government support, falling battery costs and economies of scale, a Dutch bank has predicted.  However, ING warned that with battery-powered vehicles accounting for 100% of registrations in 2035 across the continent, European carmakers would lose out to their rivals in the US and Asia who already lead on battery production.  The forecast is much more aggressive than most other projections, such as the UK’s National Grid which on Thursday said it expects 90% of new cars in Britain to be electric by 2050.  France’s commitment last week to banning new petrol and diesel car sales by 2040 suggests it also thinks the roll-out of electric vehicles will be slower than ING’s report expects.    However, the bank said that it believed pure electric cars would “become the rational choice for motorists in Europe” sometime between 2017 and 2024, as their car showroom prices fall, their ranges increase and charging infrastructure becomes more widespread.  By 2024, the report’s authors forecast that in Germany the cost of ownership for an electric car – including buying and fuelling it – would be the same as a conventional petrol or diesel model.  The bank said the shift to electric will be underpinned by falling battery costs.  Motorists’ concerns over “range anxiety” will also evaporate in the 2020s, ING said, as the distance between charges goes from the 100-150 miles of most models today to 400 miles and above in the next decade.  Eventually, by the end of the next decade, carmakers will begin focusing solely on electric models, the report said. Swedish firm Volvo recently marked the beginning of this trend, saying it would only launch hybrid, plug-in hybrid or 100% electric cars from 2019.  ING expects battery-powered cars will beat hydrogen versions on both price and infrastructure. However, the bank said that European carmakers were likely to miss out in the coming electric revolution, because Asian and American competitors had the advantage in battery technology and electric motors. “Europe’s competitive advantage in internal combustion engine powertrains disappears with the shift to battery electric vehicles,” the report said.  Tony Seba, an economist at Stanford University in the US who has published research on the cars, said: “Our findings clearly indicate that essentially all vehicle miles travelled will be electric by 2040 [worldwide].  “The car industry faces an imminent technology disruption by AEVs [autonomous electric vehicles] in the early 2020s. Even without autonomous technology, the internal combustion engine car industry will have been long decimated by 2040.”  The flurry of electric car announcements last week, including Volvo’s electrification strategy, prompted a pushback by big oil and some analysts.  At an energy conference in Istanbul this week, Anglo-Dutch firm Shell, Saudi Arabia’s state oil company and the International Energy Agency dismissed the idea that electric vehicles will hurt oil demand.  On Thursday, the IEA raised its forecast for global oil demand in 2017 to 98m barrels a day, with growth revised up 0.1mb/d on its projection last month, to 1.4mb/d."},{"url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/26/world/europe/uk-diesel-petrol-emissions.html","title":"Britain to Ban New Diesel and Gas Cars by 2040 - New York Times","short_content":"The shift away from internal combustion engines is in large part a result of growing awareness of the health hazards of diesel.\nSales of diesel cars are plunging.\nDiesel engines do spew less carbon dioxide, a cause of global warming, than gasoline engines.\nRather than encourage a shift back to gasoline cars, governments and automakers are focusing increasingly on electric cars.\nThey are the only vehicles that emit neither nitrogen oxides like diesel nor large amounts of carbon dioxide like gasoline.","content":"Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, promised a “green revolution in transport,” adding that the government wanted nearly every car and van on Britain’s roads to have zero emissions by 2050.  The strategy document was published after a protracted legal battle in which ministers were ordered by the courts to produce new plans to tackle illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide.  In France, the promise to end sales of traditional cars was made as part of a renewed commitment to the Paris accord.  In Britain, which is also committed to the Paris treaty, the measures have particular political significance because of rising concern over the level of air pollution, particularly in large cities like London. Poor air quality, much of it a result of pollution from vehicles, is estimated to cause between 23,000 and 40,000 deaths nationwide every year.  Frederik Dahlmann, assistant professor of global energy at Warwick Business School, described Wednesday’s announcement as “an important step” that set a clear long-term target, and “also gives car buyers an incentive to consider the different types of engine options available in light of the long-term development of the market.”  Still, he said, the long-term nature of the announcement left a significant question hanging: “How does the government intend to improve air quality and reduce transport related emissions in the short term?”  Critics, including Ed Miliband, a former leader of the opposition Labour Party and an ex-environment secretary, argued that the government was failing to tackle the current pollution crisis.  Another former environment secretary, Ed Davey of the centrist Liberal Democrats, described the government’s failure to commit to a plan to compensate diesel car owners who scrap or retrofit highly polluting vehicles as a “shameful betrayal.”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Others also say the country’s efforts are not aggressive enough — France has also set 2040 as its target, but Norway intends to sell only electric cars from 2025, and India wants to do so by 2030.  Cars typically have a life span of around 15 years, so even if Britain follows through with its target, conventional engines are likely to be on the country’s roads more than a decade later.

Britain’s decision is, however, the latest indication of how swiftly governments and the public in Europe have turned against diesel and internal combustion engines in general.  Automakers, though reluctant to abandon technologies that have served them well for more than a century, are increasingly resigned to the demise of engines that run on fossil fuels. They are investing heavily in battery-powered cars as they realize their traditional business is threatened by Tesla or emerging Chinese companies, which have a lead in electric car technology.  The shift away from internal combustion engines is in large part a result of growing awareness of the health hazards of diesel.  Cities like Madrid, Munich and Stuttgart are considering diesel bans. Sales of diesel cars are plunging. Political leaders are under pressure to end the de facto subsidies of diesel fuel that prevail in Europe.  European countries kept taxes on diesel lower than on gasoline in the belief that it was kinder to the planet. Diesel engines do spew less carbon dioxide, a cause of global warming, than gasoline engines. But they produce more nitrogen oxides, a family of gases that cause asthma and are responsible for the smog that sometimes blankets London and other major cities.  Rather than encourage a shift back to gasoline cars, governments and automakers are focusing increasingly on electric cars. They are the only vehicles that emit neither nitrogen oxides like diesel nor large amounts of carbon dioxide like gasoline.  But the impending shift has raised doubts about whether countries like Britain will be able to create the infrastructure, and generate the electricity, needed for such a radical change in the way people travel.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Jack Cousens, a spokesman for Britain’s largest motoring organization, the AA, said there would need to be “significant investment in order to install charging points across the country, especially fast-charge points,” and added that it was questionable whether the electricity grid “could cope with a mass switch-on after the evening rush hour.”"},{"url":"http://www.machinedesign.com/motion-control/europe-doubles-down-electric-cars-us-continues-embrace-gasoline","title":"Europe Doubles Down on Electric Cars as US Continues to Embrace Gasoline - Machine Design","short_content":"The future is in electricity—or at least, the future of the car industry.\nIndia is looking to not only sell exclusively electric vehicles, but also to swap all current internal combustion vehicles by 2030.\nEssentially, while the rest of world is making strides in electric vehicles and pushing new standards, the U.S. is still trying to make exceptions for gas cars.\nThe electric car industry is set to become a $731 billion market by 2027, according to IDTechEx.\nThe autonomous vehicle industry is also set to become a $127 billion industry by 2027, according to a recent market report from Research and Markets.","content":"The future is in electricity—or at least, the future of the car industry. By looking at vehicle trends over recent years, it’s easy to see that the production and sale of electric vehicles (EVs) is on the rise. According to Forbes, in 2016 EV sales jumped to 36%. This is a strong turnaround from 2014 to 2015, where the markets saw a small 5% decline in sales. By the end of 2016, there were 30 different EV models available to consumers.  The total number of EV sales was 159,139, and of those vehicles, at least five of them sold 10,000 units or more in 2016: the Tesla Models S and X, the Chevrolet Volt, the Nissan Leaf, and the Ford Fusion Energi. A large portion of these sales (more than half) took place in California. This was largely due to state’s zero-emission vehicle mandate requiring a certain percentage of car sales to be zero-emission vehicles.  Well, it appears that Europe has seen the bet and raised us. On July 6 of this year, France announced the end of petrol and diesel vehicle sales by 2040. This came one day after Volvo announced that it would only be producing electric or hybrid cars starting in 2019. Most recently, the United Kingdom announced on July 25 that it would follow in France’s footsteps—also banning the selling of petrol and diesel vehicles by 2040.  These efforts are driven by the countries’ push to meet the Paris Climate Accords. For the U.K., there is a secondary motivation to lower air pollution. A February report from the Royal College of Physicians attributed 40,000 deaths a year in the U.K. to outdoor pollution, most of which comes from vehicles.  Nor are France and the U.K. the only countries to push for EV sales exclusively. Here are the others looking to join them:  Norway had planned to join the EV-only policy by 2025. 24% of vehicles currently sold in the country are already electrically powered.  India is looking to not only sell exclusively electric vehicles, but also to swap all current internal combustion vehicles by 2030.  The Netherlands currently has a high EV sales rate, at around 6% of its total new vehicles, and is looking to be solely EV by 2025.  Germany is also considering a push to end of sales of gas and diesel cars by 2030. There is strong opposition to this, owing to the country’s strong vehicle industry, but in light of Dieselgate it may be in the country’s best interest to turn toward more EV sales.  China has been pushing its automakers to expand their production of electric vehicles—Daimler and its Chinese partner announced a $735 million investment to boost EV output this July. China is also pushing consumers to buy electric by implementing strict limits on the number of new vehicles that can be registered in major cities such as Beijing and Shanghai (though providing exceptions to EV-qualified models).  (Insert Image 2)  And where is the United States in this picture? Recently our efforts have been focused on the deregulation of efficiency standards. The current administration’s Transportation Department announced on July 25 that it is looking to revise auto fuel efficiency requirements starting with the 2021 model year, and could potentially adopt lower standards through 2025. The previous plan was to raise efficiency standards every year from 2021 to 2025. The current goal was set in 2011 and was aimed at doubling the average of fleet-wide fuel efficiency to 50 miles per gallon per 2025. The potential savings to drivers would be $1.7 trillion. Freezing the regulation in 2021 would cap the efficiency to 41 miles per gallon and benefit the auto industry in design engineering costs.  Essentially, while the rest of world is making strides in electric vehicles and pushing new standards, the U.S. is still trying to make exceptions for gas cars. The potential harm to the car engineering industry is that we will no longer be at the forefront of car technology. The electric car industry is set to become a $731 billion market by 2027, according to IDTechEx. The autonomous vehicle industry is also set to become a $127 billion industry by 2027, according to a recent market report from Research and Markets. The engineering design and investment efforts will be geared toward innovations, especially in the world of electronics. U.S. car manufacturers would benefit greatly by getting on board with electric cars before the European market leaves the rest of the world in the dust."},{"url":"https://www.ft.com/content/cc1dbf04-71fc-11e7-aca6-c6bd07df1a3c","title":"Hammond seeks 'off-the-shelf' Brexit transition - Financial Times","short_content":"$18.71 per week *Purchase a Newspaper + Premium Digital subscription for $18.71 per week.\nYou will be billed $97.43 per month after the trial ends","content":"$18.71 per week *  Purchase a Newspaper + Premium Digital subscription for $18.71 per week.

But new projects would have to go through an assessment process overseen by the Treasury to determine whether funding should be guaranteed by the UK government post-Brexit.  The government has proposed creating a “shared prosperity fund” to take over the financial assistance for regeneration previously provide by Brussels, but the LGA said this plan so far lacked detail.  The group representing local authorities said about £8.4bn was allocated through the European structural and investment funds for 2014-2020.  Kevin Bentley, an executive member of the LGA, said: “Since the referendum, one of the biggest concerns for councils has been the future of vital EU regeneration funding. Councils have used EU funds to help new businesses start up, create thousands of new jobs, roll out broadband and build new roads and bridges.  “Securing a government commitment around this vital regeneration funding has been an important step. To further its devolution commitments, we want to work with the government to help develop a fully funded and locally driven successor scheme with local government in areas of all types.”  Bentley said the current seven-year period for distribution should be maintained to allow for long-term planning, but funding should be easier to access and distributed by local areas, rather than centrally.  “With national funding for regeneration increasingly being depleted, all local areas have become increasingly reliant on EU money and local areas are desperate to get on with creating jobs, building infrastructure and boosting growth,” Bentley said.  A Treasury spokeswoman said: “As the chancellor said last year, the government will guarantee EU funding for all structural and investment fund projects agreed before we leave the EU – provided they are value for money and in line with UK priorities. This will ensure projects are not disrupted, no community misses out, and gives British businesses – and potential investors – the certainty and stability they need to help us make a success of Brexit.”"},{"url":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/28/trump-brexit-end-of-west","title":"After Trump and Brexit, is this the end for the Anglo Saxon west? - The Guardian","short_content":"What term do you want to search?\nSearch with google","content":"What term do you want to search?

Many European politicians and regulators see electric autos as critical for reducing air pollution.  KELLY MCEVERS, HOST:  Leaders in the U.K. want to make it illegal to drive a car with a gasoline or diesel engine. Britain's environmental secretary says the country will ban the sale of new gas or diesel vehicles by 2040. The plan is to phase out all cars with internal combustion engines by 2050. And this has become a movement in Europe. France and Norway have announced similar plans with pressure growing in Germany to do the same. To talk about the prospect of an all-electric, gas-free Europe is NPR's Sonari Glinton, who joins us from the studios of Youth Radio in Oakland, Calif. Hello there.  SONARI GLINTON, BYLINE: Hey.  MCEVERS: So what's the reason for the ban on gasoline and diesel in the U.K.? Is it about more than climate change?  GLINTON: Well, yes, it is in a real way about air quality. Air quality has become a really important political issue in England. As a matter of fact, electric cars and clean air was a part of the election, and it was a part of the conservative platform during this year's election. Pollution in - is getting better. But here's the key thing - in many big U.K. cities, harmful pollutants such as particulate soot and nitrogen oxides, NOx - these are the key ingredients or some of the key ingredients of smogs - that - those levels have barely dropped at all. And no doubt, this is about climate change in the long term, but right now there is a political problem. And a controversial study shows that about 40,000 Brits die prematurely connected to pollution.  MCEVERS: So is part of this poor air quality these diesel cars that are on the roads in Europe?  GLINTON: Well, yeah. Diesel is much more efficient than gasoline, but it's also dirtier. And it's hard to take out the pollutants. And that's become evident in part because Volkswagen the car maker was found to be cheating on emissions tests. And diesel has been in the headlines because of this cheating. Every carmaker in Europe has sort of been on the blocks because of their dependence on diesel. And VW has tried to save itself by turning to electric cars, in this introducing about two dozen electric vehicles in the coming years.  MCEVERS: But people aren't really buying electric cars in large numbers in Europe or here in the U.S. I mean, is going all-electric in a few - in a few decades realistic?  GLINTON: Well, I'm here in the Bay, which has about the highest - which has the highest concentration of alternative fuel vehicles. Those are hybrids, electric cars, hydrogen cars and the like. And that's only about 1 in 10 cars here. You know, that is not a hundred percent. And it's an infrastructure problem - you've got to charge your car, so you need a place to charge it. But Tesla is making a huge bet on this. And it's happening - you know, later this week they're handing over cars. And whether consumers adopt these cars here matters less and less because if Europe, China and India go electric, then that's enough electric cars to be sold for one car company.

The shadow home secretary insisted the party’s position was “quite clear” after a week of frontbenchers sharing totally different views on Brexit.  BBC Newsnight 2 Diane Abbott said that nothing was being taken off the table in terms of Brexit talks  On Sunday the Labour leader said it would be impossible for Britain to remain in the single market while leaving the EU.  In comments which incensed pro-EU Labour MPs, he said he would quit the single market because it was “inextricably linked” to EU membership.  And his shadow chancellor John McDonnell agrees with him, saying last month: “I don’t think it’s feasible” to stay in the single market, adding: “I think people will interpret membership of the single market as not respecting that referendum.”  But last night Ms Abbott insisted that the party was exploring all options.  She told BBC’s Newsnight: “The Labour party made it very clear in its manifesto that it wants a Brexit that puts jobs and the economy first.  And when questioned on Mr Corbyn’s position, she said: “I was with Jeremy Corbyn this afternoon and he was quite clear, we are not taking options off the table.”  MOST READ IN POLITICS YOU AND WHOSE ARMy?

Diane Abbott deletes fake Theresa May tweet DIANE ABBOTT has deleted a tweet with a fake quote from Theresa May about lesbians. Yesterday she put on on social media a message saying: “More on Theresa May’s thoughts on LGBT rights.” And she sent a picture of the Prime Minister with the quote: “Curbing the promotion of lesbianism in Merton’s schools starts with girls having male role models in their lives.” But there’s no evidence that Mrs May ever uttered those words – despite going viral during the last election. The Tories claim the quote was made up.  Twitter/Diane Abbott 2 Thee now deleted tweet seemingly featured a fake quote  Earlier this week leading Remain campaigner Chuka Umunna tweeted that Norway was not in the EU but was part of the single market.  And fellow Remainer Wes Streeting said it was possible of the UK to leave the EU and keep trading in the single market.  The government have said that Britain will be leaving the single market and customs union, but have paved the way on agreeing a transitional deal with the EU which could mean we will stay in in some form after Brexit day in 2019."},{"url":"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/07/28/philip-hammond-uk-will-unable-strike-post-brexit-trade-deals/","title":"Philip Hammond claims 'literally nobody' wants a post-Brexit migration 'cliff-edge' - Telegraph.co.uk","short_content":"Jack Maidment will be replying to comments on this article from 12pm today.\nLog in to your Telegraph account or register to join in the debate.\nPhilip Hammond has claimed “literally nobody” wants a post-Brexit migration “cliff-edge” as he suggested that businesses and public services would be in trouble without migrant workers.\nThe Chancellor has said that the UK’s existing migration system would effectively remain in place in the immediate aftermath of withdrawal from the EU.\nMeanwhile, he said that a transitional deal with the bloc could last for up to three years and that interim arrangements would likely mean the UK would be unable to sign any new trade deals until after 2022.","content":"Jack Maidment will be replying to comments on this article from 12pm today.

They described the idea as \"absurd\" and \"unconstitutional\". One senior member of the group -- the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP)-- suggested it now meant \"a very hard border\" returning to the island.  It is a particularly sensitive issue given the decades of violence in the province that ended in a peace deal less than 20 years ago.  The border between the Irish Republic, a member of the European Union, and the British province of Northern Ireland will be the only land frontier between the United Kingdom and the European Union once Britain leaves the bloc in early 2019.  Politicians in London, Dublin, Belfast and Brussels have all said they want to avoid the return of a \"hard border\" on the divided island, although no progress has yet been made. It is one of the key decisions to be made before a Brexit agreement can be reached.  In the latest wrinkle, The Times newspaper reported that the Irish government's preferred option is for customs and immigration checks to be located away from the land border and at ports and airports.  That would effectively draw a new border in the Irish sea -- possibly meaning one between Britain and its province.  Ian Paisley Jr, one of the 10 DUP members of the British parliament allowing May's government to stay in power, went on Twitter to condemn the idea.  \"1 of 2 things will now happen 1. A very hard border 2. Ireland will wise up and leave the EU,\" he said.  May has said she wants the post-Brexit border to be as seamless as possible. Dublin, meanwhile, fears anything resembling the land border posts of the past could pose a risk to peace.  About 30,000 people cross the current, invisible frontier each day for work and many farms straddle both sides of the border.  Any hindrance to cross-border trade would hit Northern Ireland harder. The Republic accounts for 25 percent of Northern Irish exports outside the UK, compared with just 1.4 percent going the other direction.  \"Absurd, Unconstitutional\"  Officials from the Irish government agency responsible for customs checks said in May that checks 10-15 km (6-9 miles) from the frontier were being considered. Then-finance minister Michael Noonan raised the possibility of control points at airports and ports over a year ago.  Such a scenario would be unacceptable to the euroskeptic DUP which was the only major Northern Irish party to campaign for Brexit and which wants to boost the union with Britain in the face of calls by Northern Irish nationalists to unite both sides of the Irish border.  \"There is no way that the DUP would go for an option that creates a border between one part of the United Kingdom and the other. Dublin really needs to understand that the proposition is absurd, it's unconstitutional,\" DUP MP Jeffrey Donaldson told BBC Radio.  Overall, 52 percent of voters in the United Kingdom voted in favor of leaving the EU in last year's referendum, but a majority -- 56 percent -- of those voting in Northern Ireland supported remaining in the bloc.  The Times also quoted a British government source as saying Dublin's attitude on Brexit had hardened since the election last month of Prime Minister Leo Varadkar and his appointment of Simon Coveney as the country's new foreign minister.  Coveney said last month that Britain and Ireland could not pretend that they can solve the border problem through technical solutions such as cameras, while other ministers have become more vocal about the slow progress in talks so far with one calling the British position politically incoherent."},{"url":"http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/brexit-list-uk-expats-europe-amber-rudd-home-office-funding-whitehall-theresa-may-a7864381.html","title":"Amber Rudd is the only Government minister taking Brexit seriously – it's time the rest of the Cabinet followed suit - The Independent","short_content":"I worked for 15 years in Europe after 1979 and no-one ever called me an “immigrant”.\nA foreigner, yes, or if they really wanted to insult me, English, but the term \"immigrant\" is very loaded in all languages.\nBut at last we might get some accurate facts and figures on Europeans living and working in the UK.\nOn Brexit we embarked on taking an even bigger decision without any real examination.\nNow Amber Rudd has taken the lead in deciding we do need a proper Brexit audit on Europeans working here.","content":"At last someone in government is doing what government should do.

I worked for 15 years in Europe after 1979 and no-one ever called me an “immigrant”. A foreigner, yes, or if they really wanted to insult me, English, but the term \"immigrant\" is very loaded in all languages. The CEOs of our high street banks, or the head of the LSE, or endless football managers are all strictly speaking “immigrants” from Europe but somehow Messrs Conte, Wenger or Rolet don’t get described as such.  But at last we might get some accurate facts and figures on Europeans living and working in the UK. The head of the Brexit department in the German Foreign Ministry told me earlier this year as I was researching a new book on Brexit that Berlin has been asking London for more than two years for an accurate list of EU citizens in the UK.  None was available. We don’t do ID cards. NI registration is hit and miss and doesn't cover cash-in-hand work. Many do not fill in electoral registration forms. Unlike most European countries no-one is obliged to register with a local council or even the police when they rent or buy a home.  In fact, it is surprising that before and since the referendum no-one in Whitehall has attempted any serious inquiry into the impact of Brexit on different sectors, regions, universities or all the British expats in Europe.  Boris Johnson didn't know about the major report into impact of Brexit  There have been a few Parliamentary inquiries but these depend often on conflicting statements by witnesses. There is much media comment but most Brexit debate is polemical and denunciatory.  Can other Whitehall Departments copy the Home Office and launch Brexit audits so that we can finally move out of the sterile Leave vs Remain Punch and Judy show and have some rational discussion?  There is a good precedent for this. When the Euro was launched many called for the UK to join. This was politically impossible as Tony Blair, before the 1997 election, had announced there would have to be a referendum on Euro entry. I was a PPS and Minister at the FCO 1997-2005 and while strongly pro-European I never thought for an instant that there was any chance of Blair committing a David Cameron type of political suicide by risking a referendum.  As Blair said to me one day, “I am not going to go down in history as the PM that took us out of Europe.” Instead, he passed the hot potato to Gordon Brown who, before 1997, was even more Europhile than Blair. Brown dreamt up the famous five economic tests and the Treasury went to work producing five volumes of thousands of pages on all aspects of possible Euro entry.  Everyone in government knew that this was a way of buying time as the decision had been made not to risk a referendum. But the work was of high intellectual quality and showed a serious government seriously examining the consequences and costs of such a major decision.  On Brexit we embarked on taking an even bigger decision without any real examination. Now Amber Rudd has taken the lead in deciding we do need a proper Brexit audit on Europeans working here.  Other departments could do the same on analysing what will happen to foreign direct investment if we leave the single market without a new trade deal. The Northern Ireland department and FCO should be looking at the consequences of leaving the Customs Union on border custom checks in Northern Ireland. What will happen to university funding once European money is cut off and can the Transport Department report on what leaving EU open sky arrangements means for aviation?  May is holidaying in Italy where no decision is taken at federal, cantonal or communal level without exhaustive inquiries into pro and cons. When she comes home she should ask all her cabinet ministers to produce Brexit audits so that in every sector the public can feel confident that the government has fully examined the consequences of different types of Brexit before it is too late.

Joseph Muscat, who has been on the inside track of the Brexit talks in recent months while Malta has held the rotating presidency of the European council, has spoken of his growing belief that the UK will remain an EU member.  “The will of the people can have disastrous consequences, history teaches us,” Muscat said in an interview with the Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant. “I could name some examples, but they’re so horrendous they’d raise the wrath of my British friends.  “For the first time, I’m starting to believe that Brexit will not happen. I am seeing hopeful signs that indicate things will change. I see encouraging signs that the tide is turning. I’m not saying the Brits have made a mistake, but the mood is changing.”  Muscat, who is leader of the Maltese Labour party, added: “People see that their fundamentally valid vote has been given an answer that does not offer a solution.  “The referendum was democratic, but has resulted in a situation in which everyone loses. Doubt is creeping in. It would be good if a political leader in the UK stands up and is courageous enough to address this new situation. Someone who says: let’s put the Brexit end-deal to a popular vote.”  As it stands, the final deal negotiated with the EU will be put to a vote in parliament. Theresa May has suggested that holding a referendum on a withdrawal agreement would only encourage Brussels to present punitive terms in the hope of keeping the UK inside the bloc.  Muscat, however, also dismissed suggestions that Britain was not well-prepared for the negotiations with the EU. In recent days, the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has complained about a lack of position papers from Downing Street on key issues, including the so-called divorce bill. Barnier told EU ambassadors on Wednesday that hopes of widening talks to take in a future trade deal were likely to be dashed unless the British changed their ways.  The Maltese prime minister, a former MEP who studied for a doctorate in the UK, said he did not believe London had stinted on its preparations. “People who say the Brits don’t know what they are doing are wrong,” he said. “I have lived in Britain, I know the British mentality. A non-prepared British government official simply doesn’t exist.  “The problem isn’t that London is prepared badly, but that the EU is prepared extremely well. That much became clear when Michael Barnier asked me, ‘Do you know how many cats and dogs travel from Dover to Calais every year? Do you know what’s to be done with the animal passport?’ Such detail! That’s when I knew: the EU is excellently prepared.”  Muscat, who won re-election in June, campaigned against his country joining the EU in 2003 over fears of job losses.

The chancellor confirmed multiple reports over the past week that the cabinet had agreed to seek a transitional period of about three years, ending before the next election, which is due in 2022.  He said there was broad consensus in the cabinet that such a period would be necessary to cushion the impact of leaving the EU.  Maltese PM: I'm starting to believe Brexit will not happen Read more  The agreement was made last week but not announced by Theresa May, who has left the UK for a three-week holiday. Instead, the news has seeped out from other cabinet ministers, and was confirmed by Hammond on Friday morning.  Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, the chancellor conceded that “many things will look similar” the day after Brexit officially takes place in March 2019. A three-year transitional period would have to be agreed by the rest of the EU, and only after that would the UK have a completely new immigration system, its own trade deal with the EU, and be able to strike trade deals with other countries.  “There will be a process between the date we leave the European Union and the date on which the new treaty-based arrangements between the UK and the European Union which we hope and expect to negotiate come into force,” said Hammond.  “I can’t tell you a precise period of time because we haven’t had that discussion yet. It will be driven by technical considerations, how long it will take us to put the necessary arrangements in place. People have talked about a year, two years, maybe three years.  “I think there is a broad consensus that this process has to be completed by the scheduled time of the next general election, which is in June 2022, so a period of at the most three years in order to put these new arrangements in place and move us on a steady path without cliff edges from where we are today to the new long-term relationship with the European Union.”  Some Brexit supporters may be unhappy with the prospect of the UK being unable to strike trade deals with third parties for three years after leaving the EU but Hammond insisted the cabinet was united.  “The important point is that we are able to get started on that process and during a transition period when we would hope to have continued access to the European market it may be that during that period we don’t bring those new agreements into force. But it will take us time anyway to negotiate them.”  Brandon Lewis, the immigration minister, caused confusion on Thursday by saying free movement would end in March 2019, but Amber Rudd, the home secretary, later clarified that EU migrants would still be able to come as long as they registered their presence.  Hammond confirmed free movement would probably end in name only until 2022. “We’ve been clear that it will be some time before we are able to introduce full migration controls between the UK and the European Union,” he said. “That’s not a matter of opinion, that’s a matter of fact. During the transition period that will follow our departure from the European Union, European citizens will still be able to come here but they will have to register.”"},{"url":"http://www.businesskorea.co.kr/english/news/national/18561-eu-japan-fta-analysis-%E2%80%98fta-between-eu-and-japan-affect-s-korean-automakers%E2%80%99","title":"Analysis: 'FTA between EU and Japan to Affect S.

Paris, Madrid, and Athens will ban diesels starting in 2025. Even Stuttgart (home of Daimler and Porsche) and Munich (home of BMW) are following suit. France and Britain have pledged to eliminate internal combustion engine cars by 2040. The cars–diesel in particular–are too polluting, you see. And so the Euros are intent on replacing them with electric vehicles.  Europe has always been at war with diesel!  Um, not really. Like Oceania and East Asia, Europe and diesel were once fast allies. In its early days of the fight against climate change, Europe figured that since diesel engines burn fuel more efficiently than gasoline ones, they could reduce carbon emissions by forcing or inducing people to switch to diesel. They gave tax breaks and incentives that led to 1/3 of the European car fleet being diesel.  Then reality crept in. Diesels create more particulates, which create nasty pollution, particularly in urban areas. The Euros thought they could address this by strict emissions standards. So strict, that auto companies couldn’t meet them economically. So they lied and cheated. Brace yourself: even morally superior German companies lied and cheated! So Europe bribed people to pollute their cities. Well played!  Further, even by its own objectives the policy was a failure. Even though diesel has lower CO2 emissions, it has higher soot emissions–and soot contributes to warming. Whoops! Further, the CO2 advantage of diesel has been narrowing over the years, due to improvements in gasoline engine technology. So at best the impact of diesel on warming has been a push, and maybe a net bad.  But never fear! The same geniuses who forced diesel down Europe’s throat have a solution to the evils of diesel: they will force electric cars down people’s throats.  What could possibly go wrong?  Well, off the top of my head.  First, in the near term, a good portion of electric cars will be powered by electricity generated by coal. This is especially true if China goes Europe’s way.  Second, the green wet dream is for renewables to replace coal. Don’t even get me started. Renewables are diffuse and intermittent–they don’t scale well. They have caused problems in the power grid wherever (e.g., Europe, California) they have accounted for over 10 percent or so of generation. They consume vast amounts of land: air pollution (if you believe CO2 is a pollutant) is replaced by sight pollution and the destruction of natural habitat and foodstuff producing land. Renewables are a static technology (e.g., the amount of wind generation is limited by physical laws), whereas internal combustion technology has been improving continuously since its introduction in the 19th century. Really economic renewables generation will require a revolution in large-scale storage technology–a revolution that people have been waiting for for decades, but which hasn’t appeared.  Third, disposal of batteries is an environmental nightmare.  Fourth, mining the materials to produce batteries is an environmental nightmare–and is likely to benefit many kleptocrats around the world. Are greens really all that excited about massive mines for rare earths (notoriously polluting) and copper springing up to provide the materials for their dream machines? Will they pass laws against, say, blood cobalt? (And when they do, will they acknowledge–even to themselves–their culpability? Put me down as a “no.”)  Fifth, depending on the fuel mix, carbon emissions over an EV’s lifetime are not that much lower than those of an internal combustion car using existing technology–and that technology (as noted above) will improve.  Like I say, top of my head. But there’s an even bigger reason:  Sixth, unintended consequences, or more prosaically, shit happens. Just like the diesel box of chocolates was full of things the Euro better thans didn’t expect, and didn’t like upon consuming, the EV craze will also present unintended and unexpected effects, and in this type of circumstance, these effects are usually negative.  But they know better! How do we know? Because they keep telling us so! And because they keep telling us what to do! Despite the fact that their actual record of performance is a litany of failures. (I cleaned that up. My initial draft had a word starting with “cluster.”)  Given such a track record, people with any decency would exercise some restraint and have some humility before embarking on another attempt to dictate technology. But no, that’s not the elite’s way. That’s not the bureaucrats’ way. They have learned nothing and forgotten nothing and will continue to prove that until someone stops them. Sadly, short of revolution it’s hard to see how that can happen.  Almost all attempts by states to dictate technology are utter fiascos. The knowledge problem is bigger here than anywhere, and the feedbacks are devilishly complex and hard to predict. Look at something seemingly as prosaic and well-understood as the production of oil and gas. Ten or twelve years ago, only a few visionaries glimpsed the potential of fracking, and I doubt that even they would admit that they foresaw the transformation that has occurred. Trying to dictate a technology that is dependent on myriad other technologies, and which may be rendered obsolete by technologies not yet developed, is something that only fools do.  But alas, there are many fools in high places.  The Orwellian switch from Europe and Diesel Have Always Been Allies to Europe Has Always Been at War With Diesel is particularly revealing because rather than recognize that the experience of Europe’s pro-diesel policy makes a mockery of policymakers pretenses of foresight, the failure of that policy is spurring them to embark on an even more speculative binge of coercion!  If you think CO2 is an issue, tax CO2 and let the market figure out the optimal way of reducing emissions: there are many margins on which to adjust, including technical innovation, fuel substitution, changes in lifestyle. Yet these madmen (and women) and fools insist on dictating technology right after their past dictates have proved failures. Worse than that: they are issuing new ukases because their old ones were crashing failures.

Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger released two new songs late Thursday in which he critiques Brexit and the “changing political situation” that propelled the U.K.’s vote to leave the European Union.  Jagger, who supported Remain in the referendum, paints a bleak picture of the U.K. in the songs titled “England Lost” and “Gotta Get A Grip.”  In “England Lost” he sings: “I went to see England but England lost / I went round the back but they said piss off,” in a line perhaps referring to the U.K.’s “back door” attempts to keep the benefits of EU membership despite having left.  Jagger also sings the lines: “I think I’m losing my imagination/ I’m tired of talking about immigration / You can’t get in and you can’t get out / I guess that’s what it’s really all about.”  The unsettling video that accompanies the song shows a sharp-suited man who grows increasingly agitated as he runs from an unknown terror towards the coast. He is eventually forcibly dragged back onto the beach as he attempts to flee into the waves. A girl asks him, “Where did you think you could go … pull yourself together.”  The songs contain “a sense of vulnerability of where we are as a country,” he said in a statement, according to Rolling Stone. He wrote the songs as a response to the “anxiety [and] unknowability of the changing political situation,” an apparent nervous breakdown.  In “Gotta Get a Grip,” Jagger is cutting about the U.K.’s political leadership and media establishment: “The world is upside down / Run by lunatics and clowns / No one speaks the truth and mad-house runs the town … Everybody’s stuffin’ their pockets / Everybody’s on the take / The news is all fake.”  And in an apparent reference to Environment Secretary Michael Gove’s comment during the 2016 referendum campaign that “people have had enough of experts” Jagger sings: “Refugees under your skin / Keep ’em under, keep ’em out / Intellectuals shut your mouth.”"},{"url":"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-air-france-klm-alliance-idUSKBN1AD1Z5","title":"Airlines' Atlantic pact guards against budget rivals and Brexit - Reuters","short_content":"The ability to offer customers a host of extra flights could give U.S. carrier Delta an edge against domestic rivals including American Airlines (AAL.O) and United Airlines (UAL.N).\nMost of the transatlantic market is controlled by joint ventures involving global airline heavyweights.\nThe new alliance would have about a 27 percent share of transatlantic flights, ahead of the 24 and 22 percent for the other two rival groupings.\nSee graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2h8wLx0Walsh declined to comment further on what the impact would be on IAG's own transatlantic partnership with American Airlines.\nHe said, however, he remained positive on the outlook for the transatlantic market despite the recent increased competition.","content":"An Air France Airbus A318 aircraft lands at the Charles de Gaulle International Airport in Roissy, near Paris, July 28, 2017.  BERLIN/NEW YORK (Reuters) - A transatlantic alliance between three global airlines will shore up their position in the lucrative UK-U.S. market, shielding them from low-cost rivals and the uncertainties of Britain's exit from the European Union.  Delta Air Lines (DAL.N), Air France-KLM (AIRF.PA) and Virgin Atlantic [VA.UL] have announced plans for a 15-year partnership on routes between Europe and the United States and equity deals which will see them take stakes in each other.  The joint venture, announced on Thursday, will see the three carriers share their profits on transatlantic routes. It will give Air France-KLM greater access to the Britain-U.S. market - among the most profitable - while the Franco-Dutch group's short-haul European flights could bring more customers to Virgin's U.S.-bound flights from London.  The ability to offer customers a host of extra flights could give U.S. carrier Delta an edge against domestic rivals including American Airlines (AAL.O) and United Airlines (UAL.N).  The new alliance also provides the partners with a hedge against Brexit in the business travelers market, should Britain's EU departure lead to companies moving to the continent, and a consequent drop in air traffic from London.  Global banks have already said they could move thousands of jobs out of Britain to prepare for Brexit, while two major EU regulators are seeking new homes.  \"This is a play on Delta's part to protect itself as Brexit unwinds should London lose traffic,\" said Atmosphere Research Group analyst Henry Harteveldt.  The partnership, expected to come into effect in 2018, will also strengthen the three big players' positions, at a time when low-cost entrants Norwegian Air Shuttle (NWC.OL) and Wow Air are shaking up the U.S.-Europe market - though their share of flights remains small.  It will also allow for better use of the airlines' London Heathrow slots, analysts said, allowing them to free up extra short-haul capacity and move it to long-haul routes.

Benoit Tessier  'Skin in the Game'  The partnership, which is subject to regulatory approval, would combine two existing and overlapping transatlantic joint-ventures, supported by equity deals worth $1 billion.  Willie Walsh, CEO of rival airline group IAG (ICAG.L), said Air France-KLM's investment in Virgin Atlantic - it plans to take a 31 percent stake - could give it a bigger say in how Britain's aviation landscape looks post-Brexit.  Slideshow (2 Images)  \"It probably represents a positive in terms of the Air France position in what the rules should be after Brexit ... they have skin in the game,\" he told analysts on Friday.  Most of the transatlantic market is controlled by joint ventures involving global airline heavyweights.  The new alliance would have about a 27 percent share of transatlantic flights, ahead of the 24 and 22 percent for the other two rival groupings. See graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2h8wLx0  Walsh declined to comment further on what the impact would be on IAG's own transatlantic partnership with American Airlines. He said, however, he remained positive on the outlook for the transatlantic market despite the recent increased competition.  It is not known which ownership rules will apply after Brexit, and whether Britain will remain part of the single European aviation market or the EU-U.S. Open Skies pact and analysts expect carriers to look for creative solutions.  Air France-KLM said on Friday that it had agreed an insurance plan for ownership of Virgin Atlantic, which would see Virgin Group, whose stake is due to drop to 20 percent, regaining a majority share should the carrier need to be UK-owned after Brexit.  \"In terms of influence in the important Heathrow and North Atlantic market this ticks all the boxes, and with (Virgin Group boss) Richard Branson moving to a minority position it will allow potentially a realignment of usage of Virgin's Heathrow slot portfolio,\" consultant John Strickland said."},{"url":"https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2017-07-28/brexit-web-tangled-by-spats-over-when-to-leave-irish-border","title":"Brexit Faces Bumps in the Road - U.S. News & World Report","short_content":"","content":null},{"url":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/28/brexit-likely-to-create-a-rise-in-uk-megafarms","title":"Brexit likely to create a rise in UK megafarms - The Guardian","short_content":"The huge intensive farms, in which as many as 1.7 million animals may be kept on a single holding, are an increasingly common, but controversial, feature of UK agriculture.\nChickens have become the focus of concerns over the effects of Brexit, with a row over whether the UK should import chlorinated chicken from the US, and chicken farming is likely to be the first to expand.\nBut in the densely populated UK, there is less space for such large developments and inevitably people will be affected.\nPeople living near such facilities have complained of overpowering smells, noise and heavy traffic on small rural roads, while researchers have found evidence of superbugs in the vicinity of intensive farms.\nEarly concerns over the impact of Brexit on British farming centred on the issue of subsidies, worth roughly £3bn a year to farmers under the EU’s common agricultural policy.","content":"Smaller farms may be squeezed out if farmers switch to vast, intensive facilities due to the pressures the industry faces from leaving the EU, say farmers and campaigners  Leaving the EU is likely to lead to an increase in the number of megafarms dominating the British countryside, campaigners and farmers agree, with far-reaching effects for farms, consumers and those who live in the countryside.    The huge intensive farms, in which as many as 1.7 million animals may be kept on a single holding, are an increasingly common, but controversial, feature of UK agriculture. The pressures of Brexit on farming are likely to cause more farmers to move to such facilities in order to lower the costs of meat production, and may squeeze smaller more traditional farms out of the market, potentially changing the UK’s landscape forever.  Chickens have become the focus of concerns over the effects of Brexit, with a row over whether the UK should import chlorinated chicken from the US, and chicken farming is likely to be the first to expand. Richard Griffiths, chief executive of the British Poultry Council, said: “The poultry meat industry is the only livestock sector that is capable of quickly scaling up production to meet growing demand and support increased self-sufficiency [post-Brexit]. Large-scale farming done to a high standard is a national asset. A secure post-Brexit deal must be about Britain’s future food security and safety.”  UK has nearly 800 livestock mega farms, investigation reveals Read more  Megafarms, of a size previously rare in the UK but common in the US, are under attack from campaigners because of concerns over animal welfare, as livestock are kept in intensive conditions often without access to the outdoors. However, farming leaders argue they can deliver efficient food production without lowering standards. What both are agreed on is that they could change the nature of the countryside, as small traditional holdings are pushed out or swallowed up and the large sheds of industrial-scale farming are installed.  Tim Bonner, chief executive of the Countryside Alliance, said that the trend towards larger farms has advantages in efficiency and could deliver high-quality affordable food. But he added: “As the UK develops post-Brexit rural policy it is vital that we remember that in many parts of the country, farms are not just businesses. Entire cultural landscapes rely on traditional smaller farm units and future policy must conserve all the benefits they bring.”  Christopher Price of the Country Land and Business Association (CLA), which represents landowners and rural businesses, warned of the challenge to traditional farms, and urged intensive farmers to be sensitive to their surroundings. “The weak bargaining power of smaller farms is one of the biggest challenges the industry faces,” he said. “The real issues are the standards and ethos of the individual farmer: a good farmer will choose to meet high welfare and biosecurity standards, protect natural resources, make some space for nature [and] maintain an attractive landscape.”  Campaigners say that the nature of such megafarms mitigates against an attractive landscape. In the US, with its wide open spaces, it is easy to site megafarms away from dwellings. But in the densely populated UK, there is less space for such large developments and inevitably people will be affected. A joint investigation by the Guardian and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism has found 789 farms in the UK that would meet the US definition of a megafarm, and a rise of more than a quarter in the number of intensive farms, which are now widespread throughout the country. People living near such facilities have complained of overpowering smells, noise and heavy traffic on small rural roads, while researchers have found evidence of superbugs in the vicinity of intensive farms.  Tracy Worcester, director of Farms Not Factories, warned: “Local residents in our green and pleasant land will be poisoned by ammonia and sickened by antibiotic-resistant organisms and bioaerosols that come out of the sheds. Downwind of a mega pig farm, drying laundry is stained, you cannot eat or sit outside, flies multiply and the pervasive stink invades rooms even when the windows are closed. Tourism dries up, B&Bs and pubs close, local communities disperse.”  Claire Bass, UK executive director of Humane Society International (HSI), one of the world’s biggest animal protection charities, said British farmers would be more likely to intensify their farming to compete on price in post-Brexit trade deals. “A Brexit-fuelled acceleration in megafarms would be terrible news for people, the environment and, of course, animals. These intensive farms are also extremely harmful to the environment, causing serious damage through ammonia emissions and water pollution.”  She warned of a backlash: “HSI aims to prevent the spread of megafarms by making sure existing animal welfare laws are protected and enhanced as Britain leaves the EU.”  The debate around the effects of Brexit on British farming was intensified this week when the Brexit minister Liam Fox refused to rule out imports of meat from the US of a lower standard than the EU permits. The government had to move swiftly to reassure consumers that chicken treated with chlorine, as it frequently is in the US, would not appear on British tables, and promised that high standards of livestock welfare would be retained. In the US, for instance, animals on megafarms are often kept in cramped conditions, fed with growth-promoting hormones and routinely dosed with antibiotics. In the EU, intensive farms are closely regulated to ensure minimum standards of welfare that would rule out these US practices, though critics say these standards are still insufficient.  Despite government reassurances, the issue revealed the rifts within the cabinet over what is at stake in future trade deals, and presages more rows to come as the implications of Brexit become clearer.  Early concerns over the impact of Brexit on British farming centred on the issue of subsidies, worth roughly £3bn a year to farmers under the EU’s common agricultural policy. The government has committed to keeping these to 2022, but after that there is little indication of what will happen.  It is now clear that the impacts will be much wider, affecting the food we eat, the conditions in which animals are kept and fields are cropped, and the nature of the countryside."},{"url":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/28/brexit-split-uk-risks-tearing-labour-apart-jeremy-corbyn-john-mcdonnell","title":"Brexit has already split the UK.

The study, by the Centre for Cities and the Centre for Economic performance at the London School of Economics, found that cities with large high-skilled service sectors, such as business and financial services, are expected to be worst hit by potential tariff changes.  More prosperous places in the North, the Midlands and Wales, which have low numbers of highly skilled workers and smaller knowledge-intensive private sectors, will be least directly impacted by any form of Brexit.  But, it says, this makes them less well equipped to respond to the economic shocks ahead.  A ‘hard’ Brexit is also likely to double the economic impact of leaving the EU: the average drop in economic output across all UK cities is estimated to be 2.3% in the event of a ‘hard’ Brexit, and 1.2% in the event of a ‘soft’ Brexit.  These estimates are based solely on expected increases in trade costs.  “All UK cities face significant economic challenges after we leave the EU, but the impact of both ‘hard’ or ‘soft’ Brexit will be felt very differently across the country,” said Andrew Carter, chief executive of Centre for Cities.  “Contrary to much of the received wisdom on Brexit, it is the most prosperous UK cities which will be hit hardest by the downturn ahead – but poorer places across the North and Midlands will find it tougher to adapt,” he said.  Carter said the government should ensure post-Brexit trading arrangements remain as close to the current agreements as possible, and that cities receive enough investment to help them weather the combined challenges of Brexit, globalisation and automation.  “This research shows that focusing on the likely local economic impacts of Brexit will be a critical ingredient for policymakers when thinking about how to offset the negative economic effects that loss of trade due to Brexit will bring,” said Stephen Machin, from the Centre for Economic Performance.

Edinburgh: -2.7% (reduction in economic output)  source Shutterstock/Shahid Khan  Population (2011 census): 495,360  Voted: Remain  Reading, London and Edinburgh have the largest high-skilled service sectors in the UK. A decrease in economic activity in knowledge-intensive sectors, which include business and finance, may have knock on effects for other sectors, given their “multiplier effect” in local economies.  Business and financial services will be among those worst hit industries by Brexit.  In joint seventh place, with a predicted drop in economic output of 2.6%, come London, Aldershot, Leeds and Ipswitch.  5.

But the town’s economic success has been built with the help of a large population of migrant workers. Meanwhile, the town’s white British population has decreased substantially since 2000.  4. Swindon: -2.8% (reduction in economic output)  Population (2011 census): 209,156  Voted: Leave  Swindon has a high population of migrant workers in low-paid and low-skilled jobs. Meanwhile, the local Conservative council has implemented £20 million-worth of cuts.  Car manufacturers Honda and BMW, tech company Intel and bank Nationwide are major employers in the town. But these international companies will need to secure favourable trading agreements to continue to employ so many in Swindon.  3.

It should be taken round the back of the paragraph and quietly put out of its misery.  Since Britain voted to leave the European Union, politicians and commentators have deployed everything from cakes, cherries, cats, even golf clubs to try to explain what it might all mean.  Yet, in recent weeks, it has become clear that many of these analogies have become absurd and redundant.  The head of the UK's public spending watchdog, Sir Amyas Morse, compares Brexit to \"a chocolate orange\" that might fall apart at the first tap. The Tory MP Charlie Elphicke fears a \"Hotel California\" Brexit where \"you can check out any time you like, but you can never leave\".  The businessman Lord Wolfson likens Brexit to a frantic bus journey where the passengers are fighting over its speed and direction.  And Miriam Gonzalez Durantez, the international lawyer and wife of the former Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, compares Brexit on her food blog to a strawberry pudding: \"The crumble, just like Brexit, seems fine on the outside, though if you look attentively you can see that there is a mess bubbling up inside. And it will definitely fall apart when you serve it, no matter how hard you try.\"  Enough, please. Enough.  In the beginning, there was some sense in using metaphor to explain a complex issue. Brexit was \"soft\" if it involved continued membership of the single market or customs union, \"hard\" if it meant the opposite.  Theresa May then muddied the waters by uttering these words: \"I'm interested in all these terms that have been identified - hard Brexit, soft Brexit, black Brexit, white Brexit, grey Brexit - and actually what we should be looking for is a red, white and blue Brexit.\"  Brexit was compared to marital separation because it allowed people to distinguish between Britain's immediate exit from the EU - the \"divorce\" - and its longer-term trading relations.  But the comparison was stretched to unsustainable lengths, with discussion about who gets to divide the music collection and keep the children and so on.  Image caption To Miriam Gonzalez Durantez, Brexit resembles a fruit crumble  There was also the small problem that in this divorce one side was made up of 27 different nations. Is \"Mutti\" Merkel the mother in this metaphor and the other 26 countries her children? Up to a point, Dr Freud.  The prime minister told MPs in March she did not like the \"divorce\" metaphor. \"I prefer not to use that term with regard to the European Union because often, when people get divorced, they do not have a good relationship afterwards.\"  So her dutiful Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson, steered away from marital matters and chose a metaphor closer to his stomach than his heart. He declared that when it came to Brexit, he wanted Britain to \"have its cake and eat it\".  The EU countered with its own gastronomic analogy, saying that \"cherry picking\" the best bits of the EU would not be tolerated.  Again these clichés made some sort of sense at first but later became rather silly. I went to a seminar recently where someone declared - without irony - that Britain did not want to have its cake and eat it, it just did not agree with the EU what the recipe for the cake should be.  The debate about how much money the UK should pay when it exits the EU has prompted many figurative contortions. Some in Britain argued that when one leaves a golf club, one should stop paying the direct debit and certainly not fork out for another round of green fees.  But the European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, insisted over dinner with Theresa May in April that the EU was \"not a golf club that could be easily joined or left\"; it was a family, and Brexit should be treated as divorce.  The European Parliament's Brexit negotiator, Guy Verhofstadt, was more prosaic, comparing Britain's outstanding payments to a round of drinks, telling the Financial Times that \"it would be wrong for EU taxpayers to be asked to pay Britain's bar bill\".  Image caption Is Brexit a full-blown divorce or a mere settling of domestic accounts?  On the other side of Brussels, the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, disagreed, declaring: \"There is no Brexit bill. The financial settlement is only about settling the accounts.\"  The problem is that this only adds to the confusion. To a French speaker, \"settling the accounts\" means no more than Britain paying its debts. To an English speaker, it can just as easily mean the EU seeking its revenge.  Take the Daily Telegraph's Allister Heath, for example, who wrote that by demanding billions of euros from the UK, the EU was trying to impose war reparations. \"The last time this sort of idiocy was attempted was in 1919, at the Treaty of Versailles, when a defeated Germany was ordered to accept full responsibility for the war and to pay vast reparations to the allied powers.\"  Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption May: I’m ambitious for what we can achieve  The problem with these metaphors is that they confuse the point of the financial dispute, namely how much Britain should pay for EU spending in the future, and not just for its current and past obligations. Unless, of course, confusion is the point, a little creative ambiguity to nudge the negotiations along.  And still the metaphor-fest has rolled on.  Mr Verhofstadt - him again - has described Brexit as a \"catfight in the Conservative Party that got out of hand\". Emmanuel Macron, the newly elected French president, has said the UK is finding out that Brexit was \"no walk in the park\".  The respected commentator, Philip Collins, wrote recently in The Times, that \"leaving the European Union is a Schrödinger's cat kind of problem\". Such is his confidence in the intelligence and knowledge of Times' readers that Mr Collins chose not to offer a word of explanation.  Those of us unfamiliar with this particular feline had to reach for Google to discover it refers to a thought problem asking if it is possible to hold two contradictory truths at the same time.  Image copyright PA Image caption The EU chief negotiator's reference to hilly climbs strike may have struck a chord with the prime minister  At a recent news conference, Michel Barnier went on a flight of metaphorical Brexit fancy when he revealed that he, like Theresa May, also enjoyed hill walking.  \"If you like walking in the mountains you have to learn a number of rules. You have to learn to put one foot in front of the other because sometimes you are on a steep and rocky path. You also have to look [at] what accidents might befall you - falling rocks.\"  He added: \"You have to be very careful to keep your breath. You have to have stamina because it could be a lengthy path and you have to keep looking at the summit.\"  This is very practical or very deep. Either way, it is very French.  And it is certainly too much. Can we just agree that Brexit means Brexit and leave it at that?"},{"url":"http://kdvr.com/2017/07/22/vandals-destroy-ancient-artifacts-to-create-graffiti-at-mesa-verde/","title":"Vandals destroyed ancient artifacts to create graffiti at Mesa Verde ... - FOX31 Denver","short_content":"MESA VERDE NATIONAL PARK, Colo. — Vandals destroyed archaeological artifacts to write graffiti on the side of a sandstone cliff in Mesa Verde National Park recently.\nPark officials posted several pictures of vandalism and graffiti at Mesa Verde on a Facebook page.\nThe cliff dwellings at Mesa Verde in Colorado’s southwest corner are some of the most notable and best preserved on the North American continent.\nNot only was the cliff side vandalized, but archaeological artifacts were destroyed to do so.\n“The purpose of the National Park Service is to preserve unimpaired the natural and cultural resources and values of the National Park System for the enjoyment, education, and inspiration of this and future generations,” officials said.","content":"MESA VERDE NATIONAL PARK, Colo. — Vandals destroyed archaeological artifacts to write graffiti on the side of a sandstone cliff in Mesa Verde National Park recently.

Not as soon as it seems, even with the latest automotive news out of Europe.  First, Volvo announced it would begin to phase out the production of cars that run solely on gasoline or diesel by 2019 by only releasing new models that are electric or plug-in hybrids. Then, France and the U.K. declared they would ban sales of gas and diesel-powered cars by 2040. Underscoring this trend is data from Norway, as electric models amounted to 42 percent of Norwegian new car sales in June.  European demand for oil to propel its passenger vehicles has been falling for years. Many experts expect a sharper decline in the years ahead as the shift toward electric vehicles spreads across the world. And that raises questions about whether surging electric vehicle sales will ultimately cause the global oil market, which has grown on average by 1 to 2 percent a year for decades and now totals 96 million barrels per day, to decline after hitting a ceiling.  Energy experts call this concept “peak oil demand.” We are debating when and if this will occur.  A Forecast With Caveats  The International Energy Agency (IEA), which represents 29 oil-importing industrial countries, produces bellwether forecasts that foresee electric cars phasing in slowly. Its baseline projection envisions 150 million electric vehicles on the world’s roads by 2030, or about 10 percent of all passenger vehicles at that point. In comparison, only two million electric vehicles are operating today — 0.2 percent of the 1.2 billion on the road. The IEA estimates this shift will save nearly two million barrels per day of oil, relative to its business-as-usual projection of the world using at least 70 million barrels of oil per day for transportation by 2040. That consumption level would mark a 30 percent increase from roughly 54 million barrels now.  If electric vehicles sales grow faster than the IEA expects, that projection might miss the mark. Should that happen, would global oil demand flatten or decline?  Our research at the Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California, Davis shows that encouraging electric vehicle purchases is just one way policymakers can help phase out oil consumption — one key to reducing the greenhouse gas emissions that stoke climate change and health-threatening pollution.  Given the dominance of internal combustion engine passenger vehicles, which include cars, SUVs and light trucks, replacing them all with electric models will take decades. Automobiles are durable goods that typically remain on the road for 10 to 15 years. Not all drivers will buy a new car, let alone an electric one, soon.  In other words, even if (hypothetically) all new car sales were to instantly turn electric, it would likely be sometime after 2030 before gasoline cars would disappear. Besides, passenger vehicles consume only about 26 percent of the oil used worldwide. Given these stubborn realities and the fact that electric vehicles still represent a tiny portion of new-car sales, reaching a peak in oil demand by 2040 would require more than widespread conversion to electric-powered cars.  But together with other trends taking shape, electric vehicle growth could potentially revolutionize transportation enough for oil consumption to stop growing within this time frame.  Ride-sharing and Oil  Even if all of Europe mandated that only plug-in vehicles could be sold, starting in 2030, and China followed suit by 2035, that wouldn’t bring about peak oil demand by 2040. According to our research, global oil consumption would keep growing until as late as 2050, in part because so many cars and trucks running on gasoline and diesel — especially in developing countries — will remain in use.  To see if oil demand could still peak by the middle of this century, if not sooner, we recently began preliminary research modeling the effect of urban sustainability policies on oil demand in the future. This is an important area of analysis since U.S. mayors and municipal leaders from around the world reaffirmed their commitment to climate-change action after President Donald Trump decided to back out of the Paris climate accord.  Using a set of scenarios regarding potential technological and policy interventions in work we will publish soon, we modeled different future oil market demand conditions. We focused on four major trend lines: vehicle electrification, ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft, more sustainable freight that runs on alternative fuels or reduces vehicle miles traveled through computer-assisted optimization, and urban car-free zones.  We found that making more car-free pedestrian areas in big cities would make a huge dent in global oil demand. This practice — already common in cities like Copenhagen and Madrid in Europe and Chendu, China — could make oil demand max out by 2030, as long as enough governments aggressively encouraged drivers to switch to electric cars and mandated more fuel efficiency for road-based freight.  Trucks don’t last as long as cars, and many countries are considering policies to encourage the use of natural gas, hydrogen or electric vehicles for heavy-duty trucking.  Commercial ride-sharing might also pare oil demand by reducing the number of miles driven overall if it encourages carpooling. This industry could, in addition, hasten the shift to electric vehicle dominance if — as widely reported — it begins to rely on a fleet of autonomous (driverless) vehicles, which would predominantly be electric.  But ride-sharing could fail to reduce fuel demand in the short term if people wind up taking more trips and traveling more miles in passenger cars and relying less on the bus, transit or city train than they used to. Some research suggests that could be happening. For example, scholars at University of California, Berkeley found that a third of the riders they surveyed in San Francisco used these services instead of public transportation — not to replace trips in taxis or their own cars.  In short, there is no guarantee that more ride-sharing means we’ll burn less oil.  What Cities Can Do  In another study, our team at UC Davis teamed up with the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy, an independent global nonprofit, and modeled three urban transportation policy scenarios. We found that global new vehicle sales in 2040 will total between 600 million, if ride-sharing and transit flourish, and 2.1 billion vehicles, should the ride-sharing industry stall — a huge difference.  Metropolitan policymakers can use other tools. Creating car-free zones, making parking expensive and levying congestion taxes and road usage fees are some examples.  Overall, we believe there is a reasonable chance global oil consumption will peak by 2040. Especially given the growing preference of city dwellers to live in places with less congestion and pollution, a shift away from cars with internal combustion engines — and from cars in general — looks not only likely but inevitable. It also seems fairly likely that any company betting on the continued growth of oil sales will be disappointed.  Goldman Sachs says the world could pass this milestone sooner. Researchers at the U.S. investment powerhouse predict that with widespread reliance on electric cars, slower economic growth and a decline in (largely petrochemical-based) plastic production, global oil demand could max out by 2030.  However long it takes, shifting to electric vehicles might not make oil demand level off or decline on its own. But plug-in vehicles, combined with other policies, trends and technologies, will clearly take a toll.

The new funding will reportedly be used to further expand the development of a dataset that could be used by those developing self-driving vehicle tech. As it stands, the company is mostly focused on gathering data related to human drivers and their behavior — but the switchover to a focus on self-driving vehicle tech could obviously be quite lucrative.  This is apparently why SoftBank took part in the recent funding round, as noted by SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son when he stated: “Nauto is generating a highly valuable dataset for autonomous driving, at a massive scale.”  TechCrunch provides more: “The potential value of this data for autonomous driving is a big reason why a number of automakers have also made strategic investments in Nauto, including General Motor Ventures, Toyota AI Ventures and BMW iVentures. This funding will help really accelerate the pace of that data gathering effort, giving Nauto the ability to ‘more rapidly… gather the billions more miles of real driving experience and data required to get a precise understanding of how the best drivers behave behind the wheel,’ according to Nauto CEO Stefan Heck.  “Nauto’s tech uses a dual-camera windshield-mounted device, with one camera facing inward tracking driver behavior and the other facing outward to monitor the road. The company employs deep learning and computer vision to process the data collected by its units in the cloud, and provide insights and coaching services to counter things like driver distraction and fatigue.”  It should be noted here that Nauto’s tech is fairly cheap to deploy — hence much of the interest. The low installation and deployment costs will likely lead to large returns for some companies using Nauto’s offerings.

There are, of course, key political issues here too, but the crux of the dilemma relates to the economy and to trade. And this will be a tricky one to solve.  The key issue is that as things stand Britain has said it will leave the EU single market after Brexit and, crucially, that it will also leave the customs union. The customs union is the agreement which allows goods to move freely across EU borders.  A vital part of the customs union is that there in place what is called a common external tariff. In other words whenever goods from outside the EU enter the union, they are subject to the same controls and the same tariffs, or import duties, no matter where they enter. In this way, once goods have entered into the customs union from a third country at one point, they can then circulate freely across the union.  Now let’s introduce the chlorine washed chicken. There was a bit of a row in the UK this week over proposals for a post-Brexit free trade deal with the US and suggestions that this would allow chlorine washed chicken from the US into the UK. In the US, chicken is regularly washed - or rinsed - with chlorine after slaughtering. This is banned in the EU, not because it is unsafe as such, but because the EU says it wants to ensure high standards right through the slaughtering process.  Now it is unclear how this would be dealt with in any US/UK deal, but that’s not the point. If it isn’t chlorine washed chicken it could be Argentinian beef, butter from New Zealand or an engineering product from the Far East. After Brexit , a border is needed somewhere between Britain and the EU to control the movement of such products, make sure appropriate tariffs are applied on goods entering the customs union and that complex regulations on where products come from and their safety are met.  Frontline economy  Ireland, as the only country with a land Border to the UK, is in the frontline. The two most obvious solutions are to have the Border on the island of Ireland - and have the controls there - or to have it at ports and airports leaving and coming in to Ireland. The latter solution would be better for the Government, but it would be far from ideal, imposing new requirements and barriers on trade with Britain. But this would probably be preferable to the erection of new Border controls on the island, with all the political implications that would bring.  For the North, meanwhile, as well as the political sensitivities, there are economic issues. The Republic is a significant trading partner, but of course companies in the North sell as lot more to Britain. For this reason the idea of new controls at Larne and other ports on goods moving to the UK will not go down well.  This has all been obvious since the Brexit vote. So former taoiseach Bertie Ahern is correct when he says that a year has been wasted in terms of looking for a solution, though the Irish Government probably had little option with first the UK general election and then chaos in Westminster over the UK stance. How do you negotiate with that?  The public stance of the Government is that Britain has created this problem and it is up to it to solve it. The ideal solution would be if Britain stayed in the customs union, greatly reducing the Border problem.  Right now there are soundings that Britain might seek to remain in the union for a transition period of some years after Brexit. But once it leaves the union, the problem immediately appears - how do you control goods entering the EU customs union? Technology might make a Border, wherever it is, less intrusive. But it will not remove it  There are a range of other possible solutions which have been touted, such as the North remaining in the customs union, or having some other type of special status. But none of these solutions are perfect. When it comes to the Border after Brexit we are, unfortunately, talking about damage limitation."},{"url":"http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-40752237","title":"Brexit transition: Is cabinet fully on board? - BBC News","short_content":"Mr Hammond privately believes a new trade deal with the EU simply can't be struck by the time of Brexit, in March 2019.\nThat is why he uses phrases such as \"transitional phase\" or \"transitional period\".\nSo all that's needed isn't so much a \"transitional phase\" of further negotiation but an \"implementation period\" that puts any new arrangements in place.\nMr Hammond signalled his willingness to put any new trading arrangements with other countries on hold until after the transition.\nSo while on the surface it may look like the course of HMS Brexit appears clearer, still waters run deep.","content":"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The chancellor wants to avoid choppy waters for businesses and disruption to trade  Slowly but surely, like a submarine emerging from murky waters, the government's position on what happens immediately after Brexit is becoming clearer. And the speed of our withdrawal can now be measured, too.  Beneath the surface, Chancellor Philip Hammond had been arguing for a transitional arrangement to avoid choppy waters in 2019. There is no longer any dissent in the ranks - that concept has been agreed by the cabinet.  In return the chancellor has acceded to demands by ministers who voted to leave the EU that any transitional phase must be completed by the scheduled date of the next general election - June 2022.  But have other disagreements so far escaped the political sonar?  Mr Hammond privately believes a new trade deal with the EU simply can't be struck by the time of Brexit, in March 2019. So he would be prepared to leave things much as they are for a time.  While technically the UK would leave the single market and customs union, initially at least extremely similar arrangements would be put in place while a final free trade deal was completed. Then there would be a period where the new arrangements would be phased in.  That is why he uses phrases such as \"transitional phase\" or \"transitional period\". And on the record, he has said he wants to ensure things feel like \"business as usual\" to the British people, the day after the UK leaves.  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Technically freedom of movement ends in March 2019 but something similar could remain for a period  But others in cabinet, not least Brexit Secretary David Davis, are much more confident that the essentials of any new trading arrangements with the EU could be hammered out by 2019.  So all that's needed isn't so much a \"transitional phase\" of further negotiation but an \"implementation period\" that puts any new arrangements in place.  For example, everyone recognises that, outside of the customs union, new staff and IT systems would be required to deliver the new regime and that simply couldn't be done the day after Brexit.  And there are further potential disagreements which could threaten the current esprit de corps - how long would the free movement of labour last after Brexit?  While, technically, free movement ends with EU membership, the government has already agreed there will be a \"grace period\" when EU citizens can still come to work here freely, so long as they register with the authorities.  Image copyright AFP Image caption Mr Davis is more confident about clinching an early EU trade deal  A similar system operates in many EU countries now - and they call it \"free movement\".  The chancellor and Home Secretary Amber Rudd stress that it will take time to better police our borders, and to wean some companies off any over-reliance on migrant labour.  So the exact length of the grace period may yet end up in a graceless political dispute.  Terms of future trade could also cause conflict. Mr Hammond signalled his willingness to put any new trading arrangements with other countries on hold until after the transition.  Frankly the EU would probably demand this but it's hard to see Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, accept any ban on negotiating - rather than implementing - new deals until a transitional phase ends.  Then there is the thorny issue of which body supervises the trading rules between the UK and EU during a period of transition - would the European Court of Justice (ECJ) still have a role?  Mr Hammond has floated the idea of a tribunal, similar to the arrangements in place in European Economic Area countries such as Norway, to settle any disputes.  But if the EU insists on the ECJ, cabinet unity may yet fray. This might even torpedo any hope of a transitional arrangement that the British government could accept.  So while on the surface it may look like the course of HMS Brexit appears clearer, still waters run deep."},{"url":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jul/28/labour-can-stop-brexit-but-only-with-fresh-vote-says-sadiq-khan","title":"Labour can stop Brexit – but only with fresh vote, says Sadiq Khan - The Guardian","short_content":"The Guardian recently revealed that an overwhelming majority of Labour members support staying in the single market and customs union, and favour a second vote.\nBut the shadow cabinet is united overall in the view that Labour should be in favour of carrying out Brexit.\nHowever, the Conservatives, like Labour, will not hear any arguments for a second referendum, arguing that the vote is binding and the wishes of the voters must be carried out.\n“It’s illogical to assume we can have a better deal or as good a deal with the EU outside the EU.\nIt wouldn’t happen with a tennis club, or any club.”Tom Brake, Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesperson, welcomed the mayor’s remarks.","content":"London mayor raises hopes of remainers, arguing pledge in manifesto or second referendum would both be legitimate  Sadiq Khan has set out the possibility of Britain remaining within the EU, arguing that Brexit could be legitimately stopped if the Labour party included the pledge in an election manifesto or committed to a second referendum.    In a considered and powerful intervention that could raise the hopes of remain supporters, the London mayor described himself as “an optimist” about the possibility of the UK staying part of the European Union.  But he said it was only possible to “trump the referendum” of 2016 in which 52% opted to leave the EU with a fresh, democratic vote, which could be delivered through the next general election or a national vote on the final Brexit deal.  “For it to have credibility with the British public, there would have to be a Labour manifesto offer, because the public would say, not unreasonably, ‘Hold on a sec, we voted to leave and you’re now sticking two fingers up at us’,” he said.  “You’d have to spell out, in black and white, what we’d do if we won the general election. What could trump the referendum result is us having a manifesto offer saying, we would not leave the EU, or we would have a second referendum.”  The comments are likely to fuel Labour’s divisions on Brexit, as the leadership is adamant that the party should respect the result of 28 June last year, but some MPs believe Labour should fight for a second referendum.  The party has been pulled in different directions over Brexit by those who warn of the risk of losing working-class voters across the north if there is any loosening in support for leaving the EU, and those who warn of the fiercely pro-EU views of Labour members. The Guardian recently revealed that an overwhelming majority of Labour members support staying in the single market and customs union, and favour a second vote.  Labour’s position has softened in recent days, with Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, and John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, making clear that staying in the single market and customs union should stay on the table, contradicting previous remarks by Jeremy Corbyn and Barry Gardiner, the shadow trade secretary.  But the shadow cabinet is united overall in the view that Labour should be in favour of carrying out Brexit. In response to Khan’s comments, a Labour spokesman said: “Labour respects the result of the referendum and is making the case for a jobs-first Brexit through securing full tariff-free access to the European single market.”  Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, told the Guardian in an interview that there was “absolutely no way you can disrespect the way the people voted”.  “If it was a popular thing on the streets of Britain, there could be another referendum, but until the general public has a change of heart, we’re going to exit Europe,” she said. “The public can make their feelings clear, and there can be a groundswell for it. Politicians are political animals; they’re savvy. That’s why most of them are saying they respect the vote. But MPs haven’t changed their mind on Brexit. Most of them are weeping. They want to stay in Europe because they think this is going to be really damaging. If I got a feeling in my constituency that the public wanted to remain, I’d say: ‘Brake!’”  The government appears also to have softened its position on Brexit over the past week, as Philip Hammond, the chancellor, made clear the cabinet was united on the need for a transitional period maintaining free movement of people and goods for up to three years after leaving the EU in 2019.    However, the Conservatives, like Labour, will not hear any arguments for a second referendum, arguing that the vote is binding and the wishes of the voters must be carried out.  Sadiq Khan warns hard Brexit will cost millions of jobs across UK Read more  Khan gave his alternative view on the possibility of reversing Brexit as the Guardian shadowed him over a week, watching him face his weekly question and answer session, share a stage with his mayoral counterpart in Chicago, Rahm Emanuel, and welcome a delegation of EU ambassadors to City Hall in London.  He told the ambassadors that he hoped the EU flag, flying outside the glass-fronted mayoral building on the banks of the Thames, would stay there forever.  The mayor also expressed a belief that the capital’s prospects for business will be hit by the country’s EU exit, which was opposed by a solid majority of Londoners. “It’s illogical to assume we can have a better deal or as good a deal with the EU outside the EU. It wouldn’t happen with a tennis club, or any club.”  Tom Brake, Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesperson, welcomed the mayor’s remarks. He said: “This is an important intervention. There is growing recognition in parliament and beyond that we need a vote on the final deal, as the Liberal Democrats have long argued. Nobody voted to be made poorer, but the extreme that Theresa May is choosing is making Britain poorer already, and that’s even before we leave the single market.  “Moderates such as the mayor now need to persuade Jeremy Corbyn because so far he has been Theresa May’s best friend on Brexit, ordering his MPs into the lobbies to vote for a Conservative-Ukip Brexit.”  On the question of Trump, Khan said: “I’m a reluctant participant in this dialogue with Donald Trump, because I’m trying to be a full-time mayor doing my job, and I’m not sure what he and his son have against me, and why they are tweeting about me. We’re not schoolchildren.  “He’s the president of the United States, so I’m unclear what his beef is with me.”    Trump hit out at the mayor in the hours after people were killed and injured in the terror attack in the centre of London, taking his attempts to reassure Londoners about an increased police presence out of context.  The president tweeted: “At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is ‘no reason to be alarmed!”  His son, Donald Trump Jr, added “you have to be kidding me” after Khan said that terror attacks were part of living in a big city.  Asked if his Islamic faith might play a role in his reaction to the attacks, Khan said that if that was the case it was more about Trump than him. “Look, it’s perfectly possible to be an American or a Brit and a Muslim. They are not mutually exclusive, and for anybody to think that – I can’t understand it, not for people who hold important power.”"},{"url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/28/opinion/dunkirk-christopher-nolan-brexit.html","title":"No Dunkirk Spirit Can Save Britain From Brexit Defeat - New York Times","short_content":"Nearly one-fifth of Britain’s university staff members are from other European Union countries.\nDespite all these imported skills, Britain’s economy has stagnated since the financial crisis.\nJust about 44 percent of British exports, and more than half our imports, are with the European Union.\ncould be 3 percent to 5.5 percent lower than if we had stayed in the European Union.\nOur membership in the European Union is not a set of restraints; it is what has been propping us up.","content":"Education is a critical weakness. We claim to have a world-class system, but the latest figures from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development show that on scores for literacy and numeracy, 16- to 24-year-olds in England and Northern Ireland rank in the lowest four of the organization’s 35 member countries. More than half of that age group also have poor technological skills; they rank alongside Americans at the bottom of that pile. As a House of Lords report last week complained, businesses haven’t bothered to train Britons to make up for these deficiencies over the past decade because they could always recruit foreigners instead.  There aren’t enough British workers, with the right attitudes and the right skills, to fill the country’s jobs. The consequence is that we import huge numbers of migrants to do what Britons can’t or won’t. The manufacturing, nursing, care and catering industries all depend on foreigners. Nearly one-fifth of Britain’s university staff members are from other European Union countries. Almost 100,000 seasonal agricultural workers are needed every year to pick vegetables and kill chickens — jobs that farmers’ groups say it’s impossible to get Britons to do.  E.E.F., the manufacturers’ organization formerly known as the Engineering Employers Federation, reports that Britain is so short of workers skilled in science, technology and mathematics that three-quarters of firms struggle to fill skilled engineering posts, and a quarter recruit specifically from Europe to fill those gaps. A third of new nurses each year are European. Only one in 50 applicants to the sandwich shop chain Pret a Manger is a Briton.  Despite all these imported skills, Britain’s economy has stagnated since the financial crisis. A majority of workers still earn less in real terms than they did nearly a decade ago. Gross domestic product has been inching upward simply because there are more people in the country, but the only measure that matters, per capita G.D.P., has not risen at all in a decade. It is a shocking record. For every hour we work, we produce about a fifth less than the average among the Group of 7 countries. Only Italy has performed worse than us in productivity growth over the last 10 years.  Britain’s prosperity is also undermined by the very uneven spread of wealth. There are a handful of rich regions, with London pre-eminent, but much of the country is surprisingly poor. Nine of Northern Europe’s 10 poorest regions — including West Wales, Cornwall and Lancashire — are in Britain.  The prosperity we do have is highly dependent on our trade with Europe. Just about 44 percent of British exports, and more than half our imports, are with the European Union. Britain owes much of the foreign investment in its key industries, in cars and pharmaceuticals, precisely to the fact that the country provides an entry point for Europe. London’s financial and business services are a powerhouse of the economy, making up a third of Britain’s G.D.P., and cornering the union’s markets in this area.

It will make all our trading relationships with our nearest neighbors more difficult and expensive. It will cut the flow of European Union migrants here. As Simon Tilford at the Center for European Reform has pointed out, Britain will be much less attractive to the foreign-owned businesses that generate half its exports once they cannot sell to the Continent without barriers. We will no longer be allowed to sell financial services freely in the European Union, and whatever access we negotiate for goods will have to be, as the union has made clear, substantially worse than what we have now.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  The consequences will be serious and lasting. The organization that speaks for big business, the Confederation of British Industry, calculates that by 2020 the country’s G.D.P. could be 3 percent to 5.5 percent lower than if we had stayed in the European Union.  New trade deals with the rest of the world cannot make up for Brexit. According to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, a leading think tank, leaving the single market will cost Britain a fifth of its trade in goods (and a quarter in services). Even if we negotiated free-trade agreements with 10 leading nations, including India, Brazil and the United States — a process likely to take years — that trade would make up for only about a quarter of what will be lost.  All this is before we take into account the expense, complication and bureaucratic replication involved in leaving the union; the years of negotiating with countries around the globe; the dozens of European regulatory agencies, overseeing everything from medicines to nuclear power, that Britain would now have to set up equivalents for; the need to recruit thousands of people to manage new and more extensive customs and immigration systems.  Britons are not remotely prepared for this reality. The country is sick of low living standards, and polls show that people are fed up with austerity cuts to public spending. Voters wanted and expected Brexit to make them richer. They were told that negative forecasts of Brexit’s effects were just scaremongering by the elite and its experts; they didn’t anticipate the downsides.  Rather like an unhappy spouse contemplating a divorce in favor of marriage to a charming new amour, most voters expected Brexit to get rid of everything they didn’t like about the European Union (immigration, regulation), while blindly assuming that they would keep everything they did enjoy (prosperity, subsidies for poorer industries and regions, retirement beside the Mediterranean, free health care abroad). They hoped, in short, to have their cake and eat it, too.  The paradox is summed up by two women I interviewed recently. Both were single mothers living on benefits they denounced as far too low. Both had voted for Brexit. Both believed there were too many foreigners here. And both were scandalized when I asked whether they would take vacant jobs in cafes or shops.  “They’re immigrants’ jobs,” one said.  British business is starting to panic about the imminent damage. Already, banks are starting to move their staff out of London and into Europe, foreign investment is falling, real wages are dropping below inflation again and are forecast to fall further, the Bank of England is warning that household debt is rising to dangerous levels as people borrow to keep up living standards, and British growth in the first two quarters of this year has slumped to just 0.2 percent and 0.3 percent respectively, even as Europe’s growth has risen to more than double that.  A senior ex-diplomat, a man who has spent a professional lifetime building up Britain’s trade and its credibility with investors, is aghast at what the Brexit chaos is doing to our reputation. “The core narrative of the country for the past 40 years has been that we’re stable and politically predictable; the ideal platform for investing into the single market,” he told me. “And now we’re rudderless and in a mess.”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  These are the dismal facts that should puncture the ridiculous fantasy that Britain’s Brexiteers have sold the nation. They are why Britain’s chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, is fighting a political battle with Mrs. May’s cabinet to make our departure from the European Union as prolonged and gentle as can be managed.  Britain is not an economic powerhouse waiting to be liberated. We are a country of mediocre education and limited skills, whose preening vanity has prevented us from seeing our failings. Our membership in the European Union is not a set of restraints; it is what has been propping us up. If we insist on cutting ourselves off, parts of our economy will start to die.  Dunkirk is remembered so fondly only because, in the end, Britain was on the winning side. That wasn’t down to our plucky spirit. It was because America, with its overwhelming resources, entered the war. There is no such ally waiting to rescue us now, as we start down the dangerous path of methodically shredding our links with our neighbors and friends."},{"url":"http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1111560_renault-zoe-still-dominates-europe-electric-car-sales-longer-range-boosts-sales","title":"Renault Zoe still dominates Europe electric-car sales; longer range boosts sales - Green Car Reports","short_content":"Renault Zoe still dominates Europe electric-car sales; longer range boosts sales","content":"Follow John Add to circle    Longer-range Renault Zoe electric car, introduced at 2016 Paris Motor Show Enlarge Photo  Ask a North American driver to name companies that make electric cars, and you'll probably hear Tesla, maybe Nissan, and perhaps Chevy or BMW or Toyota.  Chinese drivers may be more likely to say BYD (and perhaps Tesla), but Europeans will likely name Renault. (And Tesla.)  The Renault Zoe, now in its fifth year but entirely unknown to U.S. and Canadian buyers, continues to be the best-selling battery-electric car in Europe.  DON'T MISS: Long-range Renault Zoe electric car reviewed in U.K.: Forbidden Fruit  Its maker is part of the longstanding Renault Nissan Alliance, which recently added Mitsubishi to become the fourth largest automaker in the world collectively.  The French maker just released its first-half global sales figures, and the Zoe continues to dominate the sales charts within Europe.  In Europe, as Renault notes, overall the carmaker had 26.8 percent of the market for battery-electric and plug-in hybrid cars.  Longer-range Renault Zoe electric car, introduced at 2016 Paris Motor Show Enlarge Photo  Its first-half sales volumes grew 34 percent, and registrations of the subcompact hatchback Zoe rose 44 percent.  That meant the Zoe remains Europe's top-selling electric vehicle.  READ THIS: Renault Zoe electric-car owners can double their range by upgrading leased batteries  One factor that may keep the Zoe, which went on sale in late 2012, at the top of the charts is this year's substantial upgrade in battery capacity.  Launched in 2012 with a 22-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery and an effective range of 60 to 90 miles, it now offers a 41-kwh pack that gives a range of 300 to 400 kilometers (185 to 250 miles) on the European test cycle.

And those owners who leased their batteries rather than buying them outright can swap in their old 22-kwh battery for a brand-new 41-kwh one, gaining a far longer range in their existing car.  CHECK OUT: 2017 Renault Zoe electric car: larger battery doubles range  In its home market of France, meanwhile, the Zoe leads even more decisively. It represents almost 70 percent of all plug-in electric passenger cars sold in the country.  The 9,200 Zoes registered from January through June were more than 40 percent higher than the same period in 2016.

This should at least partially offset the negative impact of increased Japanese imports on the competitiveness of the EU auto industry, caused by the elimination of EU tariffs,” stated ACEA Secretary General, Erik Jonnaert.  Today, EU import duties on passenger cars amount to 10%. Duties on commercial vehicles are 10-22%. ACEA requests that any schedule for the elimination of these tariffs should reflect the status of automobiles as sensitive products and should be a minimum of seven years.  Despite the South Korea free trade agreement being in force for almost six years, certain non-tariff measures have remained unresolved, resulting in significant costs for EU manufacturers.  “It is therefore of vital importance that the EU negotiates a more robust automotive annex in the EU-Japan free trade agreement, which encourages regulatory collaboration, but also allows for issues to be addressed in case of non-compliance,” stated Jonnaert.  ACEA also requests that the agreement should provide rules of origin provisions that are consistent with other EU free trade agreements. Jonnaert: “Any relaxation in rules of origin could have a significant impact on the competitiveness of our industry, and thus on the overall balance of the agreement.”  Despite the current EU import duties, Japan already accounts for the highest import value for cars in the EU (worth 9 billion euros), and is the second highest importer in terms of volumes (representing over 20% of all imports).  *Automotive World is not responsible for the content of this news release."},{"url":"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/07/28/must-not-let-remainers-fudge-brexit-would-cost-us-good-deal/","title":"We must not let the Remainers fudge Brexit – it would cost us a good deal - Telegraph.co.uk","short_content":"We've noticed you're adblocking.\nWe rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.\nWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.\nThank you for your support.","content":"We've noticed you're adblocking.

Speaking on the Today programme, the Chancellor confirmed that ‘many things would look similar’ the day after Brexit. The new Cabinet consensus for an implementation period while the UK moves towards a new relationship with the EU is something Philip Hammond has been lobbying for for some time.      The expectation in Whitehall is that Theresa May will give a speech in September setting out in more detail the government’s view on Brexit and transition. But the emerging Cabinet compromise is becoming clearer by the day. Philip Hammond gets a three year transition in which not much will change to try and smooth out the process of leaving. In exchange, the Brexiteers get their version of Brexit – Britain out of the single market and the customs union.  Another thing that makes this compromise more palatable to Tory Leavers is that Hammond is acknowledging that the transition period would need to end before the next election in 2022. This would mean that the opposition can’t turn the next election into a referendum on Brexit.  The next question then becomes if the EU will accept this Brexit transition period. One suspects that Brussels’ initial reaction will be to insist on further progress on the divorce payment and citizens rights’ before discussing it. But a, relatively, off the shelf transition deal would be hard for the EU to refuse without this looking like a hostile act that would call into doubt future cooperation."},{"url":"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/labour-stop-brexit-eu-sadiq-khan-general-election-a7866121.html","title":"Brexit: Labour could still stop the UK leaving the EU, says Sadiq Khan - The Independent","short_content":"The Brexit referendum result could be \"trumped\" if Labour used its next general election manifesto to commit to not leaving the EU, or holding a second referendum on withdrawal, London mayor Sadiq Khan has said.\nIn a pointed intervention after days of conflicting signals on Brexit from senior Labour figures, Mr Khan insisted he was an \"optimist\" about the chances of the UK staying in the EU.\n\"What could trump the referendum result is us having a manifesto offer saying we would not leave the EU, or we would have a second referendum.\"\nLabour has been accused of facing in different directions over Brexit after leader Jeremy Corbyn insisted the party wanted the UK to leave the EU single market, before shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said nothing was off the table.\nSources close to Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said he was working closely with the Chancellor to take the UK out of the EU.","content":"The Brexit referendum result could be \"trumped\" if Labour used its next general election manifesto to commit to not leaving the EU, or holding a second referendum on withdrawal, London mayor Sadiq Khan has said.

Writing in The Mail On Sunday, she said: “If there’s another way of getting a frictionless trade deal that protects jobs and rights at work, trade unions would love to know.”  Labour’s London Mayor, Sadiq Khan, also used an interview over the weekend to suggest that Brexit could still be “trumped” if the party used the next general election manifesto to commit to holding a second referendum on withdrawal.  In response to the interventions, a spokesperson for Labour told The Independent: “Labour respects the result of the referendum and is making the case for a jobs-first Brexit, through securing full tariff-free access to the European single market.”  According to The Observer, some figures within the party are also seeking to force an emergency vote at Labour’s annual conference in the autumn, with the aim of committing the party to back membership of the single market.

The Japan-EU agreement should add momentum for reviving the TPP pact among its remaining 11 members, including Japan.  An FTA is aimed to promote mutual trade by reducing or eliminating barriers to trade such as tariffs, benefit consumers on both sides by lowering import prices, and enhance the competitiveness of industries that stand to gain from greater exports and create more jobs. There will, of course, be sectors that face tougher competition with increased imports. The years set aside for phasing out the tariffs should be effectively used to turn those sectors — most often the agriculture in the case of FTAs involving Japan — resilient toward the onslaught of cheaper imports. Such efforts will be essential to show that free trade works, instead of wreaking havoc to domestic jobs as claimed by people like Trump.  The 12-nation TPP was to create a free trade area covering nearly 40 percent of the world’s gross domestic product. The Japan-EU partnership agreement, which both sides seek to seal by the end of the year and implement in the early part of 2019, will still cover nearly 30 percent of the world’s economy. Efforts must continue to resolve remaining issues before a final deal is reached, such as a mechanism to settle disputes between businesses and governments of their investment destination. The broad agreement should also help accelerate the efforts afoot to save the TPP among the 11 signatories other than the U.S. — Japan will host a meeting of chief negotiators of the 11 countries in Hakone, Kanagawa Prefecture, this week.  The Japan-EU free trade talks, launched in 2013, took on an additional significance after the Trump administration, with its “America First” agenda, pulled the U.S. out of the TPP and sought to renegotiate the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement right upon its inauguration — in a major challenge to the global efforts on free trade architecture. Negotiations that led to the agreement declared by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and EU leaders last Thursday focused on the tariffs on Japanese cars and vehicle parts shipped to Europe, as well as European cheese imports to Japan.  Once the deal is sealed, the 10 percent EU tariffs on Japanese passenger cars will be phased out in eight years. More than 90 percent of the 3-4 percent tariffs imposed on vehicle parts imports will be lifted immediately. Of Japan’s 4.1 million vehicle exports last year, only some 600,000 units are shipped to the EU market, where the 10-percent tariffs expose them to stiff competition with local rivals such as Volkswagen and Renault. Japanese automakers struggle with falling demand at home amid the declining and graying population, and have been seeking cuts to the tariffs to boost exports and keep up domestic production and jobs. Cuts to tariffs on vehicle parts will also shave the roughly ¥30 billion imposed on such imports by the carmakers’ plants in Europe.  The EU has meanwhile been pushing Japan to open up its cheese market, where consumption has been growing rapidly. Japan agreed to set a low-tariff import quota for EU-made cheese of 20,000 tons, to be expanded to 31,000 tons in the 16th year of the accord, with the tariffs to be phased out over the period. The quota is estimated to account for 25-40 percent of cheese imports from the region. Both sides have also agreed to immediately scrap import duties on wines. Such steps will cut the price of imported products to the benefit of Japanese consumers.  Government support will need to be provided to domestic sectors, likely including dairy farmers, that will face the tighter competition with imports. But the support should be provided not merely to ease their pain from the liberalization of their markets, but to reform the sectors so that they can compete with the imports. This is particularly important since the nation’s farming sectors — often viewed as threatened every time Japan concludes a free trade deal — are already reeling from structural problems of their own, including the rapid aging of farm producers. The pending free trade deal with the EU should be considered as yet another opportunity for the affected sectors to beef up their productivity and competitiveness with public support."},{"url":"https://cleantechnica.com/2017/07/01/electric-car-market-27-europe/","title":"Electric Car Market Up 27% In Europe - CleanTechnica","short_content":"Electric Car Market Up 27% In EuropeJuly 1st, 2017 by Jose PontesRenault Zoe Recovers Its BreathThe European passenger plug-in market had more than 21,000 registrations last month, up 48% over the same month last year.\nYear-t0-date, the market is up 27% this year, with the EV share standing at 1.4%.\nThat was enough to win for the 5th time in a row the monthly best seller trophy in Europe.\nAnyway, these are solid results for the BMW model, especially in Norway, which saw 410 registrations, all of them being fully electrics!\nAlso published on EV Obsession’s EV sales page and the EV Sales blogspot.","content":"Electric Car Market Up 27% In Europe  July 1st, 2017 by Jose Pontes  Renault Zoe Recovers Its Breath  The European passenger plug-in market had more than 21,000 registrations last month, up 48% over the same month last year. Year-t0-date, the market is up 27% this year, with the EV share standing at 1.4%.  With quality control issues solved in the second half of the month, the Renault Zoe was once again Master in Command, with the BMW i3 and Outlander PHEV recovering some ground over the ageing Nissan Leaf.  Monthly Plug-In Model Ranking  #1 Renault Zoe — With certain quality glitches now a thing of the past, the French Zoe was back at its usual self, landing 2,095 registrations, up 26% YoY (year over year). That was enough to win for the 5th time in a row the monthly best seller trophy in Europe. Overcoming these hiccups, the model performance increased across Europe. In its home market (France), it saw 1,230 registrations. In Germany, it saw 271, up 17%.  #2 Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV — After a series of depressing months, the Japanese SUV has finally found a dosage of bright sunshiny days again, ending May in second place across the continent. It had 1,842 registrations, up 28% YoY. Mitsubishi found a new golden neighborhood for selling its PHEV — with it this time being Scandinavia, more specifically Norway (343 registrations) and Sweden (297 registrations). So, it seems the good ol’ Outlander will continue to be a resident on the top 5 list.  #3 BMW i3 — The German hot hatch was up 151%, reaching a respectable 1,629 registrations in May. This time around, 3 out 4 units sold were the fully electric variety, a great contrast with what happened 12 months ago, when the REx variety used to outsell the all-electric version. What extended range does, huh? Anyway, these are solid results for the BMW model, especially in Norway, which saw 410 registrations, all of them being fully electrics! The i3 also had a good month in its home, Germany (297 registrations) — well, relative to other months’ sales and other model sales there. Looking ahead, expect deliveries to slowly drop as people anticipate another revised version with presumably more range, coming later in the year.  #4 Nissan Leaf — Thanks to deep discounting, this ageing hatch is resisting the newer offerings, reaching 4th place despite the growing competition. It even managed to grow 8% last month, to 1,378 registrations. With steady sales in its stronghold markets (France, UK, and Norway) and sales increasing significantly in Sweden (153 registrations, up 99% YoY), the veteran model is keeping momentum by appealing to a new demographic still untapped by EVs: Bargain Hunters.  #5 Volkswagen Passat GTE — Back in the top 5, VW’s favorite PHEV company car recorded 1,170 registrations last month, its best result since January. The largest markets for the Passat GTE were Norway, with 340 registrations (sarcasm mode on — what a surprise!), Sweden (342 registrations) and Germany (177 registrations). With the right mix of space, electric range, and interior quality, expect this model to continue to be a regular here.  YTD Ranking — Zoe Steady in #1, Nissan Leaf Climbs to #2  Looking at the YTD (year-to-date) ranking, the top positions remained stable (see disclaimer*), with the most notable change being the VW Passat GTE surpassing the Tesla Model S and reaching the #5 spot.  Other models on the rise are the BMW 225xe Active Tourer, now #9, and the VW Golf siblings (the all-electric e-Golf and its PHEV GTE relative), which are profiting from the restyled unit deliveries to recover previous positions. The Golf GTE is now in #14 and the e-Golf #15.  Looking below the Top 20, there are some hot sellers bubbling up, like the recently arrived BMW 530e (397 registrations, a new record), the Opel Ampera-e (Chevrolet Bolt in Eurospeak), registering 232 deliveries last month, and the Toyota Prius PHEV, which had 286 registrations … which is the nameplate’s best European result in four years.  Looking at the manufacturer ranking, BMW (20%) is comfortably seated on the top spot, followed by Renault (13%) in second place. The #3 position is being hardly fought by Nissan (11%), Volkswagen (10%), Tesla (9%), and Mercedes (9%). With the Wolfsburg brand now making the restyled Golf plug-ins at full speed, expect it to beat Nissan soon and race Renault for the #2 position.

Scotch whisky is one of our most important exports, and provides a huge boost to the Scottish economy John Lamont - Scottish Conservative MP  Brussels also provides identical protection for Irish whiskey and even whisky from Spain and the French regions of Brittany and Alsace. By contrast, the Scotch Whisky Regulations 2009 are the most recent update of a British legal framework going back to the Scotch Whisky Act 1909. Under UK law, Scotch must be produced at a distillery in Scotland from water and malted barley and must be matured in an excise warehouse in Scotland in an oak cask for not less than three years.  GETTY - STOCK IMAGE Scotch whisky must be produced at a distillery in Scotland  In addition, the law states that Scotch is the only type of whisky which may produced, matured or blended in Scotland and it is illegal to label, package, sell or advertise any other drink as Scotch whisky. There are also rules about exports, labelling, distillery names, locality and regional geographical indications, maturation, age and distillation and even packaging and advertising.

Theresa May has promised to maintain the “frictionless” transport of goods between the UK and the EU despite her plan to leave the Customs Union – although she has more recently amended this pledge to “as frictionless as possible”.  The Europe-wide economic consultancy Oxera said that if no trade deal is reached when the UK leaves the EU, customs checks would cause lengthy border delays, resulting in slower trade.  The report, authored by Oxera’s head of transport and entitled, Brexit: The implications for UK Ports, suggested huge lorry parks would have to be built in south-east England to cope while longer motorway queues would be an inevitable consequence of greater customs control.  “We estimate the impact of such a scenario to be at least £1bn per year. This is an extremely conservative estimate – it does not account for the economic costs of the uncertainty involved, the extra staff needed (for hauliers, ports and customs officials), the congestion associated with calling Operation Stack [which would see the M20 used as a makeshift lorry park], the land required for the additional customs checks [in the form of lorry parks], or of the wider economic impacts of jobs moving overseas due to uncertainty over the operation of just-in-time logistics,\" it said.  “The full cost is likely to be much higher.”  The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has warned the UK’s hopes of securing “frictionless” trade are unrealistic.  Speaking last month, he said: “Some in the UK say you can leave the customs union and build frictionless trade. That is not possible.  “Some in UK say you can leave the single market and keep all of the benefits. That is not possible.”  UK goods trade with the EU is valued at £466bn. Since the single market was established in 1993, goods leaving the UK for the EU and vice versa have not been subject to customs checks on either side.  The report warns that the event of “no deal” between the UK and the EU on a customs union would have “extremely serious” economic consequences.  “Business in both the UK and the EU needs to know very soon the customs rules under which they will be trading. The decision cannot be part of a last-minute deal on the eve of Brexit, due to the time it will take to get trade moving under the new arrangements. The costs to logistics businesses and their customers, users of the road network and, eventually, jobs in the UK of a relatively limited increase in friction will be considerable.  “And ‘no deal’ on an alternative customs union would have extremely serious consequences for the UK economy. Providing a policy direction in this area should be a priority for the government when Parliament returns from recess.”  In pictures: European Parliament Brexit discussions        12 show all In pictures: European Parliament Brexit discussions                      1/12 European commission member in charge of Brexit negotiations with Britain, French Michel Barnier listens at the President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker speaking at the European Parliament in Strasbourg Getty Images  2/12 Frank-Walter Steinmeier, President of the Federal Republic of Germany, delivers his speech at the European Parliament in Strasbourg EPA  3/12 European Union's chief Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt, President of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE), addresses the European Parliament during a debate on Brexit priorities and the upcomming talks on the UK's withdrawal from the EU Reuters  4/12 Michel Barnier, European Chief Negotiator for Brexit reacts during a meeting at the European Parliament in Strasbourg EPA  5/12 Member of the European Parliament and former leader of the anti-EU UK Independence Party (UKIP) Nigel Farage wears socks with Union Jack flag at the European Parliament in Strasbourg Getty Images  6/12 Nigel Farage, United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) member and MEP, addresses the European Parliament during a debate on Brexit priorities and the upcoming talks on the UK's withdrawal from the EU Reuters  7/12 European commission member in charge of Brexit negotiations with Britain, French Michel Barnier gestures during speeches at the European Parliament in Strasbourg Getty  8/12 The President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker (L) speaks with European commission member in charge of Brexit negotiations with Britain, French Michel Barnier at the European Parliament in Strasbourg Getty  9/12 European Union's chief Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt, President of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE), addresses the European Parliament during a debate on Brexit priorities and the upcomming talks on the UK's withdrawal from the EU Reuters  10/12 Getty  11/12 German president Frank-Walter Steinmeier delivers a speech during a plenary session at the European Parliament in Strasbourg Getty Images  12/12 The European Parliament in Strasbourg, eastern France Getty Images  A statement from the Government said the post-Brexit relationship being sought with the EU had been set out in its White Paper and the Lancaster House speech made last year by the Prime Minister.

For the year through June, the market is up 30% this year, with the EV share now standing at a record 1.5%.  The Renault Zoe is a bit like cyclist Chris Froome — it seems no one can get the car out of the yellow jersey, with the French hatchback being once again the continent’s best seller. Tesla models profited from their usual last-month-of-quarter peak to climb a couple of positions in the ranking.  Monthly Model Ranking  #1 Renault Zoe — With quality glitches now a thing of the past, it was all hands on deck at Renault in June, with the French Zoe scoring a record 4,189 registrations, up 73% YoY, enough to win (for the sixth time in a row) the Monthly Best Seller trophy in Europe. Or all 2017 trophies … as Zoe nailed a number of individual performance records across Europe. The Zoe set records in Germany (680 sales), Norway (428 sales), Austria (237 sales), and Portugal (112 sales), all while managing to post a positive result in the all-important domestic market (France), with 1,882 sales.  #2 BMW i3 — This German hot hatch was up 161%, to 1,634 registrations, with 3 out 4 units sold being the fully electric variety — a great contrast with what happened 12 months ago, when the REx variety used to outsell the all-electric version. What extended range does, huh? Anyway, these were solid results for the BMW model, especially in Norway, which saw 420 sales, all of them being fully electric. The i3 also had a good final score in its home country of Germany (315 sales). Looking ahead, expect deliveries to slowly drop as people anticipate the revised version coming later in the year.  #3 Nissan LEAF — Thanks to deep discounting, the ageing hatch is resisting the newer offerings quite well, reaching 3rd place and even managing to grow(!) 4% YoY to 1,590 registrations. With steady sales in its stronghold markets (France, UK, and Norway) and increasingly significant sales in Sweden (123 units, up 112% YoY), the veteran model is keeping momentum by appealing to a new demographic — bargain hunters looking for the current best value for the money out there.  #4 Tesla Model X — Back in the top 5, the EV scene’s favorite SUV recorded 1,552 deliveries last month, managing to outsell for the first time in Europe its Model S brethren. Is the Model 3’s long shadow starting to dent Model S sales?  But I digress — back to the Model X. The largest market for the SUV/minivan-that-thinks-it’s-a-sports-car was Norway, with a record 609 deliveries (sarcasm mode on — “What a surprise!”). It also did well in Switzerland (156 deliveries), Germany (136 deliveries), and the Netherlands (121 deliveries). With this model not being directly affected by the Model 3 cannibalization effect or by close competition, expect the Model X to continue to be a regular here, being only limited by its (very) high price.  #5 Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV — After a rare positive month in May, the Japanese SUV is back into a depressing sales trend, ending June with 1,435 registrations, down 8% YoY. Mitsubishi found a golden nugget in Scandinavia, more specifically Norway (349 deliveries) and Sweden (271 deliveries), but in the long run, it remains to be seen if that will be enough to keep this Japanese SUV among Europe’s top sellers.  YTD Ranking – Zoe Reinforces #1, Nissan LEAF Climbs to #2  Looking at the YTD ranking, the top positions remained stable, with the Zoe increasing its lead. The most notable changes were the Tesla Model S returning to the #5 spot and its Model X sibling climbing two positions to #8.  Other models on the rise are as follows:  The Audi A3 e-Tron, up one position to #11 thanks to 943 deliveries, its best this year.  The VW e-Golf, which was #6 in June thanks to a record 1,409 deliveries, allowing it to jump to #13 YTD. Comparing with the plug-in hybrid Golf GTE, the new 36 kWh super-sized e-Golf outsold it in June on a 2-to-1 ratio, whereas last year it was the GTE outselling the 24 kWh e-Golf on a 2-to-1 ratio.  So, as with the BMW i3, the longer the range of the fully electric version, the higher the sales of the all-electric version (consequently dropping the sales of the plug-in hybrid or REx version).  Looking below the top 20, there are some hot sellers bubbling up, like the recently arrived Mini Countryman plug-in hybrid (510 units in June, a new record) and the Opel Ampera-e (Chevrolet Bolt in Euro-speak, registering 392 deliveries last month). Note that the Ampera-e deliveries totalled a drop in the ocean of orders that Opel has across the continent for this model (there are more than 4,000 orders in Norway alone).  One advice to GM: Instead of producing units mainly for California, only to win dust on local dealerships, why not start to allocate production for the orders already made in Europe? I know ZEV credits are nice and all that, but there are more ways to win money … and while you’re at it, in Canada, South Korea, and the rest of the US, there are also buyers waiting for months (years?) for their Chevy Bolt, you know?

With the Wolfsburg brand now in #3 and making the restyled Golf plug-ins at full speed, expect it to race with Renault for the #2 position soon.  Cool Kids  Looking at new models, the big news is the thundering arrival of the Porsche Panamera plug-in hybrid, while the much awaited Hyundai Ioniq PHEV and Smart ED offerings have also just arrived.  Porsche Panamera PHEV — With 595 deliveries in June, by far the nameplate’s best performance ever (the previous record was 189 units), the second edition Panamera PHEV landed in Europe with a bang. The headlining news of the month for the model was that it hit 198 deliveries in Germany, or 46% of all Panamera deliveries that month. But record performances happened across Europe, so if these numbers are any indication of the future, this could be a disruptive model in its segment, and possibly even a serious sales competitor to the Tesla Model S, something unthinkable a couple of years back. This is also a good sign for the 2020 Porsche Mission E.  Hyundai Ioniq PHEV — This version of the Ioniq has been a long time coming. With Hyundai still flooded with orders of the fully electric version, the Korean carmaker finally decided to launch the PHEV version as well, recording 170 deliveries in its first sales month. With competitive specs and pricing, this will be another model whose success will be dictated by production constraints, something that unfortunately has become the norm among Hyundai-Kia plug-ins.  Smart Fortwo & Forfour ED — With several months of delay, we finally have the second-generation Smart Fortwo ED, this time accompanied by its 4-seater sibling, the Forfour ED. With similar specs as the first generation and still no fast charging, do not expect an EV revolution to come from here, but with a debut month of 424 units for the Fortwo ED (best result since December 2014) and 161 deliveries for the Forfour ED, a combined output of over 1,000 units per month is expected.

It is tempting to say the UK government is in headlong retreat from its original Brexit plan. But that would assume there was a well-articulated vision in the first place. We now only hear faint echoes of the “no deal is better than a bad deal” as the penny seems to have dropped that any deal is likely to be superior to the “cliff-edge”, whereby the UK ceases to be a member of the EU in 20 months’ time with nothing agreed.  Talk of “transition” has been joined by suggestions of “implementation”, with nobody quite sure of the difference between the two. It amounts to a realisation that it’s all very complicated, all very damaging: so push out the date to the last possible moment – currently assumed to be the date of the next general election which most Tories hope will not be until 2022.  In one of her few good decisions, Theresa May has dispatched Boris Johnson to the furthest reaches of the ex-colonies where he can do least mischief. Her one other sensible move has been to take herself away from the UK, leaving policy to be made by the few adults left in Whitehall.  Bluster  But even in Australia, Johnson continues to bluster and demonstrate an utter disregard for both reality and detail.  The increasingly irrelevant and hapless trade secretary, Liam Fox, is bogged down by rows over potential imports of chlorinated chickens from the US: free trade with America opens up all sorts of possibilities including, apparently, ingesting the same amount of chlorine as swimming in a municipal pool with your mouth open. Perhaps Mr Fox should try it.  Curiously, lifelong Eurosceptic David Davis, now minister for Brexit, seems to have allied himself with the chancellor and is warming to both implementation and transition. Ditto the charmingly bonkers Michael Gove.  Home secretary Amber Rudd announced this week that immigration reform would heed the requests of employers. The new approach to immigration seems to involve allowing free movement after 2019 but calling it something else.  Rudd announced the classic delaying tactic: a committee has been commissioned to examine the needs of the labour market and the role of immigration. The committee will deliver its report just six months from Brexit so Rudd promised “…our immigration proposals [will] ensure there is no cliff-edge on the UK’s departure for employers or individuals”.  In anyone’s language that must involve free movement. Except that the immigration minister, Brandon Lewis, insisted after the Rudd proposals were published that free movement will definitively end in 2019. Officials offered the clarification – an attempted reconciliation of the irreconcilable – that, post-2019, EU citizens can come to live in the UK provided they register. They also will probably not get automatic long-term residence rights once the implementation period is over.  All of that will look like freedom of movement to most people in the UK. So it will enrage the Brexiteers. But it isn’t freedom of movement as defined by the EU so it will be rejected in Brussels. This is just one illustration of the complexity and contradictions inherent in trying to appease the Brexit hard-liners, reach agreement with Brussels and minimise the economic fallout.  While Britain continues to try and work out what to ask for in the Brexit negotiations, the position of the EU is clearly hardening.  Tougher stance  When the people on the other side of the negotiating table are in chaos it is rational to respond with a tougher stance. While Britain stumbles towards shambolic acceptance of the inevitability of a softer and longer Brexit, the EU might as well turn the chaos to its own advantage. That means not compromising until the very last minute. With the result that businesses will be forced over the next couple of years to move from contingency to action and actually start to move activities out of the UK.  My guess is that until a late-night summit some time early in 2019, the EU will insist that “transition” means the UK accepting every single piece of EU law, continued payments into the EU budget, the four freedoms (in full), the jurisdiction of the Europeans Court of Justice and all rules and regulations – including any new ones formulated during the transition period.  The only difference will be the UK won’t be in the EU so will not have a voice during any discussions of new rules and laws.  Brexiteers can see all this coming so are already preparing there own lines of attack. Nigel Farage has started to pen articles about “the great Brexit betrayal”. Their only possible line of defence will be to demand a cliff-edge departure. Logic dictates no other approach.  Brexit isn’t dead yet but it is certainly unwell. Whether the condition is chronic or terminal remains to be seen."},{"url":"https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2017/07/cows-can-explain-brexit/","title":"How the economics of cow-milking can help explain Brexit - Spectator.co.uk (blog)","short_content":"Farmer One milks his 50 cows only once a day.\nHe voted Remain.\nFarmer Two milks 120 cows twice a day in the time-honoured way.\nFarmer Three milks his 1,000 cows three times a day by employing a team of Romanians working in shifts for 20 of each 24 hours.\nAn instinctive Leaver, but voted Remain to keep the Romanians.","content":"Writing about judicial appointments, I incautiously compared a silly interview question asking a judge to cite an example of when he had acted with integrity, to asking a farmer, ‘How many times a day do you milk your cows?’ Jamie Blackett, a farmer, writes to say that, in the 21st century, it is a question to which the answer reveals much.

The warnings from senior leave campaigners and allies of the Brexit secretary, David Davis, come as ministers prepare to clash over issues of immigration and trade in a series of key meetings this autumn.  Hammond and Fox are not on the same Brexit page Read more  Philip Hammond, Amber Rudd, Damian Green, David Gauke and Greg Clark are among those likely to push the prime minister to accept that while free movement will officially end, there should be no immediate move to reduce immigration.  But the divisions in the cabinet were laid bare as Liam Fox said in an interview that there was no cabinet-wide agreement on what a post-Brexit implementation period should look like, and warned that “control of our own borders” was a key driver of the leave vote.  One Whitehall source who is close to Davis said it would be helpful if other ministers let him get on with the job of negotiating with the EU, stressing that the final deal would determine what any implementation period would look like.  Iain Duncan Smith, former Conservative leader and key Brexit supporter, added: “Conservative backbenchers now wish cabinet members would practise what some are preaching and that they ‘transition’ from saying too much about Europe to saying nothing at all. This is a transition that should last up to two years.” The question of a transitional deal has been forced up the agenda since May lost her majority in June’s election, emboldening the proponents of soft-Brexit in her cabinet.    The ministers will hammer out what would be acceptable to voters this autumn when May chairs a number of sessions of her cabinet sub-committee on leaving the EU.  While the prime minister is on holiday, the chancellor has made a series of interventions, including claiming that the UK’s relationship could look “similar in many ways” for some time after formally leaving the bloc in 2019. He has been supported by Rudd, who ordered an analysis of EU migration, but also made clear that EU citizens would be free to continue coming to the UK during the transition period, as long as they registered.  The Guardian understands that a letter from the home secretary setting out the policy was not shared with cabinet colleagues. Fox and Boris Johnson were also not primed to expect a major government announcement on the issue last week when they were both out of the country, although they were aware of the policy.  Liam Fox denies cabinet deal on transitional EU free movement Read more  Separately, the chancellor has denied that he wanted to turn the UK into a deregulated, Singapore-style economy. Hammond told France’s Le Monde: “I often hear it said that Britain is considering participating in unfair competition in regulation and tax.  “That is neither our plan nor our vision for the future. The amount of tax we raise as a percentage of our GDP puts us right in the middle of the pack.” He argued that after Brexit the country would keep a “social, economic and cultural model that is recognisably European”.    Sources have revealed that senior Treasury officials want to maintain a close association with the EU customs union during transition, but also have not ruled out retaining that relationship in the long term. That could prevent the UK signing new free trade agreements in the future – a move that would increase tensions between Hammond and Fox.  The trade secretary has been using the recess period – when Conservative MPs are not needed in parliament to win votes – to drum up trade business around the world. Speaking to the Sunday Times on his second visit to the US in a month, he said there was no cabinet-wide agreement on migration not being controlled after March 2019, when the UK will formally Brexit.  “If there have been discussions on that, I have not been party to them. I have not been involved in any discussion on that, nor have I signified my agreement to anything like that,” he said.  One senior No 10 figure admitted that the chancellor had used the period that May was away to “fly kites” on Brexit, and “see what he can get away with in coordination with others”. They said overall Hammond was likely to be concluding “So far, so good” because of a lack of pushback from other ministers.  However, when cabinet figures meet for discussions in September, differences may well emerge, and they are likely to come under pressure from MPs on both sides of the argument.  Anna Soubry, an advocate of soft Brexit, said: “Hammond speaks with authority and common sense. It’s clear that at last the economy and jobs are at the heart of a sensible and smooth Brexit.” She urged colleagues to put their ideology to one side and get behind the chancellor and prime minister. “These Brexiteers promised a land of milk and honey – the reality is gruel and chlorinated chicken,” she said.  A cabinet minister agreed that the chancellor was right, saying Hammond had set out a “sensible approach that enables us to deliver the referendum result while protecting the economy from a cliff edge”. They said that meant there would have to be some time before full migration controls were introduced.  Brexit border chaos will cause huge delays and cost £1bn a year, says report Read more  But a member of the European Research Group – representing backbench Tories determined that Brexit takes place – said the key was for a “closed end process with a certain outcome: control of laws, borders and money”.  The government’s first hints at what a post-Brexit migration system will look like are likely to land in late autumn when the Home Office publishes a white paper. The immigration minister, Brandon Lewis, is said to be meeting a series of industry groups to help design a framework, and will be looking into how the government’s IT systems will support a registration system that will have to deal with 3 million EU citizens living in Britain.  Charles Grant, director of the Centre for European Research, said he had visited officials in Paris and Brussels and said that the EU was as determined as Britain that any transitional phase would only last two to three years.  But he warned that free movement may well need to continue in principle, even if it is technically ended. “If we want a transitional deal including the single market and customs union, which is what business wants, it will need to be off the shelf.    “That means it is something similar to the Norway option, with four conditions that will have to be accepted: free movement, paying into the budget, following EU rules including new ones, and accepting ECJ rulings.”"},{"url":"http://www.denverpost.com/2017/07/30/scotch-whisky-brexit/","title":"Scotland to Britain: Protect Scotch whisky after Brexit - The Denver Post","short_content":"LONDON — Scotland has called for Scotch to be defined in U.K. law so its vital whisky industry can be protected after Brexit.\nScottish Economy Secretary Keith Brown has written to officials asking for strong legal protections for the industry, which is worth around 4 billion pounds ($5.3 billion) in exports.\nA European Union definition of whisky currently protects sales from substandard products — but EU laws will no longer apply to Britain after the country exits the bloc in 2019.\nBrown’s comments Sunday came after Britain’s International Trade Secretary Liam Fox visited the U.S. this week for trade talks.\nBrown said the U.S. has voiced support for relaxing the definition of whisky, which he said would open the market to products that don’t meet the current standard.","content":"LONDON — Scotland has called for Scotch to be defined in U.K. law so its vital whisky industry can be protected after Brexit.

His comments came after Japan and the European Union signed a free-trade pact that has displeased some parts of Japan's agriculture sector. Aso told reporters it was too early to offer details on the size of any additional spending on the farm sector or how it would be funded. But the minister said he wasn't interested in simply handing out subsidies to farmers who are too weak to compete with an expected increase in dairy and lumber imports from the EU once the trade pact takes effect. Aso's comments show the government is likely to turn a deaf ear to any requests for a huge spending increase, and suggest Japan will put more emphasis on improving logistics in the agriculture sector. \"I don't want backward-looking policies based on the assumption that we will lose out to increased competition,\" he said. \"I want forward-looking polices that will help us win at the export game.\" Japan and the EU agreed early this month to create the world's biggest open economic area and signal resistance to what both sides characterised as a shift to protectionism by U.S. President Donald Trump.

In return, the EU will eliminate tariffs of up to 10 percent on Japanese cars over seven years.

The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter.  London’s financial executives have warned of the dire consequences for jobs and investment of a “cliff-edge” Brexit, in which no mutual free trade deal is struck before the two-year renegotiation period ends. With little progress made more than a year after the vote, firms such as Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc. have activated their contingency plans to move or hire hundreds of bankers in expanded hubs inside the EU, with Frankfurt and Dublin the biggest beneficiaries so far.  HSBC Chairman Douglas Flint also used the bank’s quarterly results to reiterate a warning that the fragmentation of the European banking industry to locations outside London would lead to increased costs and less financing for countries and corporations.  “Europe must not allow its financial capacity and capabilities to be diminished,” Flint said in the earnings statement. There is a question whether “the economies of Europe will continue to have access to at least the same amount of financing capacity and related risk management services, and as readily available and similarly priced, as they have enjoyed with the U.K. as part of the EU.”  For example, the Bank of England has estimated a single basis-point increase that might result from splitting the clearing of interest-rate swaps could cost firms across the euro zone 22 billion euros ($25.8 billion) a year, according to a June 27 report. London could lose 10,000 banking jobs and 20,000 roles in financial services as clients move 1.8 trillion euros of assets out of the U.K. on Brexit, according to think-tank Bruegel."},{"url":"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/07/31/chances-completing-brexit-march-2019-infinitesimally-small-says/","title":"Chances of completing Brexit before March 2019 'infinitesimally small', says Archbishop of Canterbury - Telegraph.co.uk","short_content":"The Archbishop of Canterbury has warned that the chances of completing the Brexit process before March 2019 are “infinitesimally small”.\nThe Rt Rev Justin Welby has previously called on Theresa May to set up a cross-party commission to advise her on Brexit to “draw much of the poison” from negotiations.\nHe has now suggested that such a commission is needed for the UK to have any chance of reaching agreement on the myriad issues in need of resolution before the point of withdrawal from the European Union in 18 month’s time.\nHe told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that he was “not exactly surprised” that his call for a Brexit commission to be set up had not happened but added that “it may yet”.","content":"The Archbishop of Canterbury has warned that the chances of completing the Brexit process before March 2019 are “infinitesimally small”.

His warning came as HSBC reported a 5% rise in first half profits to $10.2bn (£7.8bn) and announced a $2bn share buy-back, taking the total amount returned to shareholders since the second half of 2016 to $5.5bn.    Douglas Flint – who has been at HSBC for 22 years and chairman for the last six – used his last statement at the bank to call for the rules designed since the financial crisis to be implemented globally, and also warned on the impact of Brexit on Europe’s financial markets.  A divergence in regulation runs the risk of “skewing” financial market activity to where the rules are less onerous, while the discussions over the UK’s departure from the EU will be “complex and time-consuming”.  “The essential questions that have to be addressed are whether, at the conclusion of the negotiations, the economies of Europe will continue to have access to at least the same amount of financing capacity and related risk management services, and as readily available and similarly priced, as they have enjoyed with the UK as part of the EU,” he said.  The City is focused on HSBC’s attempts to clean up its business after a series of scandals about the tax avoidance strategies used by its Swiss arm and the £1.2bn fine for money laundering by the US Department of Justice, which led to a monitor being installed at the bank as part of a deferred prosecution agreement.  The American lawyer Michael Cherkasky was appointed as the monitor five years ago and his concerns have prompted an investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority into potential breaches of money laundering rules.  Flint said there need to be increased cooperation to route out “bad actors”.  “What is.... clear is that greater cooperation between the public and private sectors, together with a refresh of bank secrecy laws and regulation designed for a different age, would significantly increase the effectiveness of our joint efforts,” he said.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Douglas Flint Group Chairman of HSBC Holdings. Photograph: Jill Mead for the Guardian  Among the ideas he endorsed was a mandatory register of beneficial ownership of corporate and other non-personal structures in every country.  HSBC’s results were accompanied by pages of legal warnings, including a legal case which began in April 2017 into allegations that it conspired with other banks to manipulate the the US bond market. There are other disclosures covering requests for information relating to the Mossack Fonseca files, investigations by tax authorities and its cooperating with the DoJ over the way it packaged up toxic bonds in the run up to the crisis. The investigation by DoJ - which has already reached settlements with eight other banks - is “nearing completion”.  In the UK, the bank’s results included a $300m hit for the payment protection insurance scandal. HSBC said it had moved 170,000 accounts to new sort codes to comply with the new ringfencing rules - known as the Vickers rules - which come into force at the start of 2019. Implementing these rules, which ring fence high street bank operations from riskier investment banks, has cost £500m and involved 2,000 staff.    Stuart Gulliver, the bank’s chief executive, focused on the amount paid out to shareholders in the last year. “In the past 12 months we have paid more in dividends than any other European or American bank and returned $3.5bn to shareholders through share buybacks,” said Gulliver, who in the financial stages of a global plan to make savings of $5bn, cut 25,000 jobs and “pivot” the business towards Asia."},{"url":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/31/eu-supports-poorer-regions-tories-abandon-brexit-funding","title":"The EU supports poorer regions.

WINDSOR, Ontario -- Two autonomous vehicles owned by suppliers Magna and Continental crossed the border between Canada and the United States on Monday, testing automated driving technology in a variety of settings.  The drive also highlighted a new memorandum of understanding between Ontario and Michigan, which, together, will help develop more autonomous vehicle technology and testing.  The vehicles, owned by Magna International and Continental, started their journey in southeast Michigan before a trip through the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel into Ontario.  They then traveled onward to cross the Blue Water Bridge, which connects Sarnia, Ontario, and Port Huron, Mich. From there, they headed about 300 miles to their final destination, Traverse City, Mich.  In a joint statement, the two suppliers, the Ontario Ministry of Transportation and the Michigan Department of Transportation called it “the first cross-border demonstration of its kind.”  MDOT director Kirk Steudle called it an \"unprecedented collaboration between two nations and private industry.\"  The two transportation regulators invited the suppliers to demonstrate their technologies as a way to highlight a new memorandum of understanding the departments will sign today. Under terms of the memorandum, the province and state agree to “further promote and foster growth of connected and autonomous technology testing and deployment, supporting both Michigan and Ontario’s economic interests and technological advancements by enabling job-creating growth for both jurisdictions.”  Cohesive partnership  “Today’s test drive is a great example of the continued collaboration and innovation between Ontario and Michigan,” Ontario Minister of Transportation Steven Del Duca said in a statement. This new memorandum of understanding and our recent commitment of $80 million for an Autonomous Vehicle Innovation Network signify the importance of a strong, cohesive partnership and continued investment in the development of AV/CV technologies and the mobility sector.”  Each supplier is testing some of its own technology used to make Level 3 autonomous driving possible. Level 3 autonomous driving requires a driver be at the wheel of the vehicle, ready to take control at a moment’s notice.  Through Continental’s own Cruising Chauffeur function, the two vehicles are able to take over driving tasks on various roadways in accordance with traffic regulations. Once Cruising Chauffeur is activated, data analyzed in a central control unit called Assisted and Automated Driving Control Unit is used to generate a 360-degree model of the vehicle’s surroundings.  Technology test  In combination with a high-resolution map, the system recognizes all moving and static objects, as well as the layout of the roadway ahead. The drive will demonstrate how the vehicles’ multiple camera, radar and lidar sensors will interact while being driven under the Detroit River through the concrete Detroit-Windsor Tunnel and across the steel Blue Water Bridge.  Continental confirmed to Automotive News back in May that it was conducting road tests in Ontario and housing the vehicles in their garage in Auburn Hills, Mich.  “Continental has been testing automated driving on public roads for more than five years and our approach is a global initiative. The engineering teams are spread across locations in the U.S., Europe, China and Japan to ensure driving and safety functions can be easily adapted to the individual regions as one comprehensive team effort,” Jeff Klei, president of Continental North America, said in a statement.  Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder, right, with Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne at the 2016 CAR Management Briefing Seminars in Traverse City. Photo credit: Greg Horvath  Regional competitiveness  Michigan and Ontario have taken steps to ensure the region remains competitive as the automotive landscape evolves. In 2016, Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder signed a package of bills enabling automated vehicles to operate on roads across the state. That year, Ontario became the first province to set a regulatory framework to permit testing of automated vehicles, making it the only province to have an automated vehicle pilot program in Canada.  “The deep integration of the Great Lakes Automotive cluster helps foster industry-leading innovation and allows companies on both sides of the border to compete around the globe,” Ontario Minister of Economic Development Brad Duguid said in a statement."},{"url":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/31/british-motorists-car-repair-bills-hard-brexit","title":"British motorists 'face 10% rise in car repair bills after hard Brexit' - The Guardian","short_content":"Car industry is latest trade group to issue warning, saying WTO tariffs and customs checks will ramp up maintenance costsBritish motorists face a 10% rise in the cost of their annual car service and repair bills if the UK leaves the EU without a trade deal, an industry body has warned.\nThe prediction comes after warnings from various industries about the impact on their sectors of a hard Brexit.\nHowever, the Guardian reported in February that leaving the EU without a trade deal would saddle British exporters with more than £6bn a year in new tariffs.\nThe SMMT said: “Some 80% of replacement car parts fitted to British cars are imported, with almost three-quarters of these coming from EU-based suppliers.\nIt would mark a significant retreat from the hard Brexit she would have pursued had she won a majority in the June election.","content":"Car industry is latest trade group to issue warning, saying WTO tariffs and customs checks will ramp up maintenance costs  British motorists face a 10% rise in the cost of their annual car service and repair bills if the UK leaves the EU without a trade deal, an industry body has warned.  The UK’s collective car repair bill could rise by more than £2bn due to tariffs and other barriers arising from a hard Brexit, according to a report published by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), which assumes the UK is forced to fall back on World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules.  The prediction comes after warnings from various industries about the impact on their sectors of a hard Brexit.  They have ranged from the UK nuclear industry highlighting the “cliff edge” faced by not replacing the existing European nuclear treaty, Euratom, to farmers warning that the price of British strawberries could rise by more than one-third if the UK cannot ensure access to European workers after Brexit.  Brexit border chaos will cause huge delays and cost £1bn a year, says report Read more  Speaking about the motor trade, Mike Hawes, the chief executive of SMMT, said: “If we don’t secure a new trading relationship with the EU that is free of tariffs and customs checks, British consumers could face significant increases to their annual car repair bill due to new tariffs and other trade barriers.  “Government must now prioritise an interim arrangement that maintains single market and customs union membership until the right trade deal with the EU is implemented.”  The SMMT’s report said a WTO tariff on imported car parts of between 2.5% and 4.5% would cost the average car owner an extra £21 a year for replacement components.  Meanwhile, quotas, subsidies, customs delays and regulatory barriers could add an additional £49, adding up to a £2.14bn rise in the UK’s collective car maintenance bill, the trade body said.  Theresa May has previously said “no deal is better than a bad deal” when it comes to the terms of Britain’s departure from the EU, suggesting the prime minister believed that falling back on the default position of WTO rules in the absence of a trade deal with the EU is a credible alternative.  However, the Guardian reported in February that leaving the EU without a trade deal would saddle British exporters with more than £6bn a year in new tariffs.  The SMMT said: “Some 80% of replacement car parts fitted to British cars are imported, with almost three-quarters of these coming from EU-based suppliers. However, the manufacture of components in the UK is growing, making the risk of tariffs on British products sold in Europe and other key global markets another major concern.”  The report concluded that WTO tariffs on automotive parts exported from the UK could cost the domestic industry up to £3bn in lost revenue, “with a potential impact on future investment and jobs”.  Despite talk of no deal, many Brexit observers believe there has been a softening of the government’s stance since the general election, with increasing talk of the UK negotiating a transitional agreement.  In research published on Sunday, the political consultancy Eurasia Group said: “To clear the air and offer more certainty to business than the government’s current nods and winks, ministers believe that May will make a major speech on Europe in September.  “This will update the government’s policy, including on the transitional period. It would mark a significant retreat from the hard Brexit she would have pursued had she won a majority in the June election.  “Until then, however, uncertainty will likely remain on what the transitional deal might involve. UK ministers have not discussed it in any depth. [Philip] Hammond accepts that the UK will technically leave the EU, and its single market and customs union, in 2019.  “At the same time, he is seeking a solution that in practice implies largely accepting free movement of labour, continued budget payments and the continued adoption of EU laws and the jurisdiction of the European court of justice, hence dubbed a ‘status quo’ transition.”  The SMMT and Eurasia reports were released as economic optimism fell to the lowest level for six months, according to the latest study of business confidence from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking.  Economic optimism slipped by one percentage point from 18% to 17%, it found.  The negative figures came as overall business confidence remained unchanged at 30% in July, the bank said, just below the long-term average of 32%.  The share of companies reporting higher business confidence decreased by three points to 45%, but this was offset by those reporting lower confidence, which fell by three points to 15%."},{"url":"http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/data-robots-automation-ippr-brexit-is-distracting-a7869261.html","title":"Brexit is distracting political parties from the real threat facing the UK – digital inequality - The Independent","short_content":"While Labour committed to taking the utilities and rail companies back into public ownership, the commanding heights of the digital economy were left untouched.\nMeanwhile, the power asymmetries embedded in platforms such as Uber are undermining labour market regulations and deepening precariousness for many.\nInsecure work, sluggish pay, and weak productivity are bigger challenges facing our labour market today than the much-heralded ‘rise of the robots’.\nAP12/41 22 July 2017 Competitors take part in the swim stage during the AJ Bell London Triathlon 2017 at Royal Victoria Docks in London, England.\nAfter all, these technologies are ultimately embedded in institutions and norms that politics – collective organising, debate, and action – build.","content":"Brexit is taking our eyes off the future. The immense complexity of the task is, like a black hole, sucking all the energy and ideas of British politics towards it. Many of tomorrow’s economic and social challenges are cast in its shade as a result. The party manifestoes – which for the most part fought yesterday’s battles – attests to this. Yet for progressives, understanding how tomorrow’s world is being shaped by emerging economic, social and technological energies is vital to making it more equitable and plentiful than today. After all, as David Bowie said, “tomorrow belongs to those who can hear it coming”.  Consider the rise of data-driven platforms. While Labour committed to taking the utilities and rail companies back into public ownership, the commanding heights of the digital economy were left untouched. Other parties were similarly quiet. Yet with digital data a ubiquitous and essential source of value, absent policy intervention four or five ‘super star’ firms are set to harvest and monetise vast swathes of data creating huge concentrations of economic power. Meanwhile, the power asymmetries embedded in platforms such as Uber are undermining labour market regulations and deepening precariousness for many.  Crucially, we risk sleepwalking into a world in which the infrastructure of the digital economy, its rules, and the power that resides in that control, is shaped and controlled by a few dominant American companies. This is the new dominant economic position that progressives need to understand and respond to. How can we build a democratically governed and owned data infrastructure that can produce greater equity and genuine innovation? Can platforms be governed in more co-operative approaches to ensure labour enjoys security and voice alongside flexibility? And how should we regulate unaccountable, private algorithms, laced through with questions of economic power? Much work is needed.  The spectre of automation also provokes breathless commentary, much of it in the short term almost certainly exaggerated and at odds with our current economic challenges. Insecure work, sluggish pay, and weak productivity are bigger challenges facing our labour market today than the much-heralded ‘rise of the robots’. Nonetheless, in the decades ahead a suite of rapidly improving technologies – large-scale data analysis, algorithmic management, machine learning techniques, the application of AI, advanced robotics, 3-D printing – constitutes a coherent set of techniques for what the urbanist Adam Greenfield calls the production of the post-human every day.  This threatens a world of spiralling inequality rather than mass joblessness. Automation risks accelerating returns to capital as those who own the technologies reap the rewards, while it could further polarise the labour market as the world of work and the type of tasks humans perform transforms.

Deepening and advancing the ideas laid out in the recent ‘Alternative Models of Ownership’ report could be one fruitful avenue but serious thought is required on all sides. Moreover, while upgraded skills is unlikely to be enough on its own to hold back automation-driven inequality, clearly more can be done to ensure that everyone is better equipped to engage with the future.  More than that, automating and associated technologies have the potential to shake the foundations of society: the relationship between employment and the production of value, our notions of scarcity, commodities, value, and time. What are the ethical and regulatory standards in which technologies should operate? What are the deals that we as a society want to strike with them? Can we use the technologies to live more agreeably and well, working less but more fruitfully? After all, these technologies are ultimately embedded in institutions and norms that politics – collective organising, debate, and action – build. We must begin that task by asking what we want from technologies and trying to create that society, rather than leaving our future in the hands of Silicon Valley.  Technological change is not bound to create a more just and fruitful configuration of economic power; we must understand the processes driving it and shape change to create a more abundant and equitable future. To do so, we need to get the future in our bones.

Asked if he thought there was any possibility of Britain changing its mind about EU withdrawal, Leo Varadkar said: “Well, I still hope that it won't happen.”  He added: “When it comes to my work in Brussels, working with other European prime ministers and presidents, it's part of my remit to keep the door open, not just to the European Union, but also to the single market and also to the customs union, should they decide to go down that route.  “That, I think, would be the best outcome for Ireland and Northern Ireland and Britain,” Mr Varadkar told The Irish Times.  The comments came as relations between the Dublin Government and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) – Theresa May’s partners at Westminster - sour over the issue of a post-Brexit border.  The DUP was told to stop ‘whinging” after protesting when Mr Varadkar said the Irish Government does not want any sort of economic border on the island of Ireland after Brexit.  The Irish Prime Minister said he would not work with London, which has put forward better technology as a potential solution to policing trade between North and South after 2019.  Nigel Dodds, the DUP deputy leader, hit out at the comments and said Dublin was positioning for a general election.  “It's simply taking things backwards at a time when common sense co-operation between our two countries and between the Republic and Northern Ireland is what's needed,” he said.  But Fine Gael Senator Neale Richmond said: “The DUP's whinging doesn't hide their political impotence.  “They would be far better off seeking to influence their Government partners in Westminster and working to get the Executive back up and running to give Northern Ireland a strong voice.”  Mr Richmond added: “Being a good friend requires one to be honest. In the Brexit debate, Ireland is the best friend the UK has and it is only right that the Taoiseach should point out when the UK negotiating side is lacking.”  Meanwhile, a Sinn Fein Stormont Assembly member claimed the DUP privately acknowledges that Brexit will be an economic disaster for the island of Ireland.  Conor Murphy suggested the DUP's public pro-Brexit stance was very different to its behind-closed-doors view, as he commented on the worsening relations between the main unionist party and Mr Varadkar.  “The reality is the DUP have been acting against the wishes of the majority of people here in relation to their approach to Brexit,” said Mr Murphy.  “They have now given the British government a blank cheque in terms of signing up to support any Brexit legislation that is brought forward.”  Mr Murphy added: “The reality is we recognise, as does everyone, including the DUP privately, that Brexit is going to be an economic disaster for the island of Ireland.”"},{"url":"http://www.nationalreview.com/article/449972/brexit-negotiations-theresa-may-lackluster-leadership","title":"Brexit Negotiations: Theresa May's Lackluster Leadership | National ... - National Review","short_content":"Last week, the latest iteration: Chris Wilkins — Prime Minister Theresa May’s director of strategy and the man responsible for much of her vision for Brexit — resigned from his post in Downing Street.\nIt was significantly less encouraging that this council’s first meeting took place in mid July, and that even then it was concerned mostly with the general outlines of Britain’s strategic vision for Brexit.\nBut her mishandling of the general election and the slow-motion Brexit catastrophe have altered that perception, and the country increasingly seems to understand that it is not in good hands.\nThere are thus two realistic scenarios for Britain’s eventual exit from the EU.\nThat scenario is bad enough that — surely — avoiding it would inspire sufficient action to negotiate some sort of deal, even a relatively punitive one.","content":"In the minds of its most fervent backers, Brexit was meant to mark the dawning of a new era for the United Kingdom, an unshackling from the straitjacket of the European Union, Britain’s glorious re-emergence as a global, cosmopolitan nation in the latter days of its golden Elizabethan era.  Perhaps at the time of the referendum that was not an unreasonable view. But it all looks so different now.

The muddle seems to infect everything; on a weekly basis, now, the embarrassment rolls in. Last week, the latest iteration: Chris Wilkins — Prime Minister Theresa May’s director of strategy and the man responsible for much of her vision for Brexit — resigned from his post in Downing Street. It is a worrying sign on two levels, suggesting both that the future within the May administration is a fruitless one and that the administration itself is increasingly bereft of the strategic vision essential to a strong negotiating position. Wilkins is only the latest to leave; Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill, May’s co-chiefs of staff, left in June after the prime minister’s woeful performance in the general election.  This is emblematic of a larger trend. The clock on the Brexit negotiations, two years in length, began ticking in March, but even at this advanced point it seems that the British government has little vision for what an eventual deal should entail or even what its negotiating stance should look like at the moment. Brexit secretary David Davis’s much-mocked session in Brussels earlier this month betrayed this fact: His European counterpart, Michel Barnier, had in front of him reams of paper detailing the EU’s stances on all sorts of minutiae, while the table in front of Davis was stark and bare.  It was, I suppose, a mildly encouraging development that May has convened a so-called business council with which she will consult from time to time on all things Brexit-related. It was significantly less encouraging that this council’s first meeting took place in mid July, and that even then it was concerned mostly with the general outlines of Britain’s strategic vision for Brexit. This was a matter that should have been taken up months — even a year — ago, not well after negotiations had begun. The business leaders’ suggestions were reasonable enough, focusing mainly on avoiding the Brexit “cliff edge” that awaits the country if no deal is agreed before the March 2019 deadline and urging May to negotiate some sort of transition agreement to cover the two or three years after the exit. But that this is still being discussed at so late an hour reflects a worrying truth: Britain does not, in a very important sense, know what it is doing.  It’s easy enough to distribute the blame for this. It predominantly falls on Theresa May herself. Not only did she fritter away two valuable months on an unnecessary general election that has done nothing but undermine her own viability as leader and throw the country’s politics into turmoil and uncertainty. It also now seems that she produced little of consequence in the months she spent in the premiership before that. She attained office after David Cameron’s resignation last summer through her reputation for diligence and competence; that sort of personality was exactly what the country needed at that moment. But her mishandling of the general election and the slow-motion Brexit catastrophe have altered that perception, and the country increasingly seems to understand that it is not in good hands. Blame might be apportioned elsewhere as well, but May must take the bulk of it.  The rosy-eyed version of Brexit — in which Britain negotiates an amicable deal with its European counterparts and through the magic of bilateral free-trade deals weathers the exit with little economic damage, all while reclaiming control over immigration and parliamentary sovereignty — is no longer on the table, and perhaps it never truly was in the first place. There are thus two realistic scenarios for Britain’s eventual exit from the EU.  The first is cataclysmic. This is the “no deal” option, in which Britain and the EU fail to arrive at an agreement by March 2019 and Britain simply crashes out of the union with no parachute in place. Britain’s trade with the EU would revert to World Trade Organization rules; a hard border would return to Ireland; goods would pile up at Dover and Calais and chaos would reign as confused agents apply customs checks and tariffs to which they are thoroughly unaccustomed; perhaps even flights between the U.K. and EU operated by British airlines would be unable to run. That scenario is bad enough that — surely — avoiding it would inspire sufficient action to negotiate some sort of deal, even a relatively punitive one.  More likely, then, is something along the lines of the deal Greece negotiated with its creditors in the summer of 2015: a harsh, political thing, full of animus and mutual distaste, inevitably concluded in a bleary-eyed session in the middle of the night just before the deadline. (The EU, in that respect, has an unfortunate tendency to resemble a lazy college student.) Britain’s interminable debate over its own negotiating stance points in that direction — the deadline may loom, but it always seems curiously off in the distance somewhere, never really meaning anything until the moment it hits. In the meantime the political class can re-run the debates it has already litigated time and time again while the level of toxicity and vitriol in the political climate makes a rational consensual policy only more difficult to attain. Eventually the sheer imminence of circumstance will force Britain’s leaders — whoever they are by that point — to adopt some position, and to recognize that the EU really did hold all the leverage after all.  But it will not be an amicable divorce. If Britain wishes to avoid either outcome, it should make every effort to cease its soul-searching and establish a firm negotiating position as quickly as possible. Otherwise it will continue its drift towards an outcome nobody desires.

However, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox, ahead of talks with US trade representatives, said there was \"no health issue\" with the controversial practice and it was \"too early\" to comment on the specifics of a free trade agreement.

The report, Farming Tomorrow, says post-Brexit Britain should grasp the first opportunity in 40 years to steer agricultural policy and give consumer interests “proper emphasis”.  It says that the UK should unilaterally phase out tariffs that increase consumer food prices and complicate future trade deals and that the EU’s common agricultural policy should be replaced by a new focus on payments for the environment.  The thinktank, which was founded by Conservatives including the now environment secretary, Michael Gove, the former minister of state for skills, Nick Boles, and another former minister, Francis Maude, says Brexit is “a once-in-a-generation chance to reform Britain’s environmental policy”.  It says that the EU policy has hindered evidence-based farming and that the British food regulator should get new powers to review scientific evidence as part of efforts to unleash free trade in agriculture.  Rates on individual products can vary wildly. Although the average EU agricultural tariff is 8.5%, EU rates for fresh beef and veal can add up to 65% to the cost of boneless cuts, while boneless mutton is 72% more expensive, potentially making these products expensive for British consumers.  The majority of US chickens – 97% – are washed in chlorinated water after slaughter. Last week Michael Gove spoke out against the practice, putting him at odds with trade secretary Liam Fox, who said it posed “no health issue”.

Moody's said the UK's weak economic climate meant it had to downgrade four of the five consumer finance sectors to negative.  The agency's warning over credit came as the Bank of England revealed that the amount borrowed by UK consumers through credit cards, loans and overdrafts had reached £200bn for the first time since the financial crash of 2008.  Inflation, triggered by the low pound, is now rising faster than wage growth and has put growing pressure on households, squeezing budgets and causing credit card spending to increase and savings to fall.  In this context, the Bank of England has expressed concerns over surging levels of unsecured consumer borrowing on credit cards, which is going up by more than 10 per cent a year and outstripping income.  Moody's analyst Greg Davies said: \"Household debt is high and still growing, leaving consumers vulnerable to an economic downturn, while higher inflation, weaker wage growth and levels of indebtedness leaves those in lower-income brackets the most exposed.  \"An additional challenge is that households' capacity to draw on savings to maintain consumption and/or service their consumer debts has significantly diminished.\"  The credit rating agency has also warned in recent weeks of the potential economic damage if the UK fails to secure an exit trade deal with the EU.  Alex Braxier, the executive director of financial stability at the Bank of England, has warned that high street banks are heading towards a \"spiral of complacency\" over consumer lending.

The newly elected chair of the Treasury select committee also called on the Bank to provide its views on what a Brexit transition deal should look like to minimise damage to the City. An analysis by the consultancy firm Oliver Wyman calculated that up to 40,000 jobs in the wholesale banking sector – which provides services to companies – could be at risk.    Morgan issued her request to Sam Woods, a deputy governor at the Bank, which had given hundreds of banks, insurers, fund managers and other major City firms a deadline of July 14 to demonstrate how they would cope with a hard Brexit.  Morgan told Woods that the committee – which is still being constituted and will not meet until the autumn – may want to consider the implications for financial services of the UK leaving the EU and that she wants him to provide the information, without providing specifics about each firm, by Wednesday.  HSBC chief sounds alarm over financial regulation and Brexit Read more  Morgan said: “The cliff edge facing businesses in April 2019 is a cause for concern, particularly in the financial services sector. Based on the information the PRA [Prudential Regulation Authority] has collected, I have asked Sam Woods about how banks and insurers will respond as the Brexit deadline approaches, and the key risks of a ‘no deal’ scenario.  “I have also asked Mr Woods for his views on the desirability and design of a transitional arrangement with the EU, to provide more time to negotiate and prepare for a new UK-EU economic relationship. Getting these arrangements right will be crucial for ensuring that the City retains its pre-eminence as a global financial centre, and to protect the economy and jobs as the UK leaves the EU.”  The Bank had called on firms to spell out plans that would allow them to keep operating in the “most adverse potential outcomes” – a hard Brexit – as well as the UK leaving the EU without a trade agreement, no implementation period, no cooperation over regulation, and no “mutual recognition”, which allows products to be sold cross-border.  Major City firms have started to publicise their plans. Bank of America said it would pick Dublin for its post-Brexit EU hub, as did Barclays. Morgan Stanley has picked Frankfurt and could relocate about 200 staff there, while Citi is also expanding its presence in the German city.  It is not just US firms that are making plans. Japan’s Mitsubishi UFJ is reportedly going to select Amsterdam to cope with Brexit.  Oliver Wyman’s report, published on Tuesday, said Frankfurt and Dublin were the main destinations for sales and trading activities after Brexit. Its analysis puts between 35,000 and 40,000 wholesale banking jobs at risk if the UK’s exit from the EU also leads to other services moving, such as clearing euro-dominated trading.  A year ago, the consultants found that a hard Brexit would cause up to 35,000 jobs to leave the UK across all elements of financial services, with 12,000 to 17,000 in wholesale banking. “Based on banks’ subsequent disclosures and our engagement across the industry, we believe this remains a sound estimate of the impact in the medium term,” the consultancy said in its update.  But the movement of jobs could be greater, they said, as banks found commercial reasons to relocate staff and with changes to the wider structure of the financial system.  The work could add up to 4% to the annual cost bases of banks – about $1bn (£755m) across the industry – and force them to hold up to $50bn more capital, cutting profits.  So far, banks were trying to restrict their Brexit responses to “no regrets” – costing little by applying for new licences – but in the next six to 12 months they would have to embark on options that cost more and were harder to reverse, the report said."},{"url":"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/ireland-eu-brexit-european-banking-authority-european-medicines-agency-a7870046.html","title":"Ireland bids to host two major UK-based EU agencies after Brexit - The Independent","short_content":"The Irish Government has made formal bids to host two agencies that will be relocated from the UK after Brexit.\nBids from the two departments to host the agencies have been submitted to the Secretary-General of the Council of the European Union.\nAround 20 cities, including Dublin, Frankfurt, Luxembourg, Paris, and Prague, are understood to be keen to host the agencies.\nThe banking and medicines agencies are seen as the first spoils of Brexit by the 27 remaining members of the EU.\nThe European Commission will assess the entries based on the quality of office space, job opportunities for spouses and transport links.","content":"The Irish Government has made formal bids to host two agencies that will be relocated from the UK after Brexit.

That’s when automakers will take a giant leap forward and switch to far stricter emission standards that are on par with those in the US, Japan and the European Union.  R.C. Bhargava, chairman of India’s largest car maker, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, sees the shift as “natural evolution” for an industry that has come a long way since the pre-Liberalization era.  The move is aimed at curbing emission in a country that has the dubious distinction of being home to half of the 20 most polluted cities in the world, according to World Health Organization (WTO) report released in June 2016. For Indian automakers such as Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd and Tata Motors Ltd, the efforts and capabilities required to leapfrog to Bharat Stage VI—the Indian equivalent of Euro VI, is akin to climbing the Mount Everest. It’s set to change the very DNA of auto companies, making them accountable for each unit of particulate matter and emission exhaled by automobiles. For car buyers, it would mean driving cleaner vehicles with advanced technology, albeit at a higher price.  What is Bharat Stage?  These are auto emission norms based on the European emission standards adopted in 2000. Each stage places a certain limit on pollutants released, which is controlled by the type of fuel produced by oil companies and the up-gradations and modifications made by automakers in vehicles to control pollutants such as NOx (Nitrogen Oxide) and particulate matter (PM). India has been adopting and enforcing the emission standards in a phased manner. BS III norms, for instance, were enforced across the country in October 2010 after they were first implemented in 13 major cities in April 2010. India now follows BS IV norms which came into effect in the entire country from April this year.  Why is BS VI inevitable?  The implementation of advanced norms is a critical step as India, the world’s third largest emitter after China and the US, is a signatory to Conference of Parties (CoP) protocol on combating climate change. As part of the agreement, by 2030 India has to reduce its carbon footprint by 33-35% from the 2005 levels.  BS VI norms will address one of the inherent flaws in the European emission standards which permits diesel cars to emit more particulate matter and nitrogen oxide, said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director at the Center for Science and Environment (CSE), a New Delhi-based think tank.  In diesel cars, the jump to BS VI norms will result in reduction of nitrogen oxide emission by 68% and particulate matter, which has a damaging effect on air quality and human health, by 82%. Similarly, in heavy-duty vehicles like trucks, the shift to BS VI norms would result in reduction of nitrogen oxide emissions by 87% and particulate matter by 67%.  India bit the bullet on advancing emission norms last January—an idea that was first mooted in 2015 before the country signed the Paris Climate Change deal. Subsequently, on 6 January 2016, an inter-ministerial group meeting chaired by Union minister for road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari and attended by heavy industries minister Anant Geete, environment minister Prakash Javadekar (now education minister) and oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan, announced that not only would India skip the intermediary step but also advance adoption by three years to 2020 from 2023. By skipping one stage India will catch up with European emission standards which are currently ahead by five years.  Even as environmentalists welcomed the decision, it set alarm bells ringing in boardrooms at auto companies and sent their product engineering teams into a huddle. Auto firms, parts makers and oil refiners are estimated to spend between Rs70,000 crore and Rs90,000 crore to comply with BS VI standards.  Given the high volumes and their presence in myriad segments of the automobile market, the leap to stage VI is giving executives at home-grown auto firms like Tata Motors and Mahindra and Mahindra sleepless nights. Unlike the local arms of the global automakers that have parent companies to fall back on, Indian companies will have to develop solutions ground up with the help of global firms specializing in emission control technologies.  The implementation of advanced norms is a critical step as India, the world’s third largest emitter after China and the US, is a signatory to Conference of Parties protocol on combating climate change  “It’s a massive work. This change took Europe nine years, we have to do it in three years,” said Timothy Liverton, president and head, advanced and product engineering at Tata Motors Ltd.  Rajan Wadhera, president automotive sector at Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd, echoed similar sentiments. “In my last 50 years, I have not seen this kind of challenge. It’s far more difficult than most of the technical transformation that I have seen in my career,” he said. But, he added, Mahindra is bracing for the challenge to ensure all its vehicles are compliant.  For Shekar Viswanathan, vice chairman, Toyota Kirloskar Motor Pvt. Ltd, upgrading to new emission standards is not a challenge. All the company needs to do is to recalibrate its Euro VI models already selling in other markets, as per the Indian driving cycle. “I think it’s a bigger challenge for companies that have a bigger footprint in India.”  Car market leader Maruti Suzuki India Ltd has around half a dozen passenger vehicle platforms, 16 models and around 150 variants. C.V. Raman, executive director, engineering, at Maruti Suzuki India, declined to comment for the story.  An email sent to Volkswagen Passenger Cars India Pvt. Ltd remained unanswered.  In an email response, a spokesperson at Hyundai Motor India Ltd said Hyundai as a global company has the technology available and is continuously introducing the same in India and meeting all the requirements. The automaker is geared up towards leading the introduction of BS VI, he said.  Paradigm shift in technology  CSE’s Roychowdhury said the transition to BS VI will bring a “paradigm shift in vehicle technology, particularly, for diesel vehicles,” as it will fundamentally alter the way emission is monitored even as it marks several firsts for the industry.  Here is how: It will require manufacturers, for the first time in India, to maintain service check data even for in-use vehicles and the way they are performing in actual road conditions. Today, the only mechanism we have to check emission from in-use on-road vehicles is a PUC (pollution under check) certificate, which Roychowdhury alludes to as “sham,” owing to its inability to check pollution effectively.  Also, for the first time, India will introduce real driving emission (RDE) standards that will be gauged through an on-board monitoring while the vehicle is being driven. It will monitor real-world emission from the vehicle and ensure that the sophisticated emission control systems fitted in the BS VI vehicles work at optimum efficiency through the life of the vehicle. With innumerable cases of in-road Euro-VI compliant vehicles emitting more than the permissible limit globally, RDE standards will be very helpful in monitoring emission effectively.  In September 2015, US regulator Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) found that many Volkswagen cars being sold in America had a “defeat device” —or software—in diesel engines that could detect when they were being tested and could change performance to improve results. This allowed the engines to emit nitrogen oxide pollutants up to 40 times above what is permitted in the US. Volkswagen admitted it was guilty of manipulating test results and recalled from all across the world 11 million diesel cars fitted with software which helped in the manipulation.  The RDE in India is being derived from the European emission regulations, said Rashmi Urdhwareshe, director at the Pune-based Automotive Research Association of India, the automotive R&D, testing and certification agency. However, the RDE cycle in India is completely different.  “It’s still under discussion in what ways is it different,” she said, adding that data collection for it is underway.  With the help of the data, the government and the test agencies will be able to firm up an agreeable test cycle for RDE in India. The exercise is expected to be completed in a year’s time. Automakers will develop and calibrate the BS VI vehicles for RDE accordingly.  The emission standards will also mark a shift in the manner in which PM is regulated. Presently, it’s regulated based on mass of PM that comes out per kilometer of distance travelled. To regulate the very fine particles that come out of a vehicle, which are extremely harmful, India will switch to number standards for PM—regulating the number of units coming out.  Fuel concerns  Oil marketing companies (OMCs) have an equally important role to play in the big shift as they need to ensure the availability of the requisite grade of fuel well ahead of the deadline. Early introduction of technology would require support from the oil companies for the BS VI fuel availability not only in a select few cities, but across the country, said Maruti’s Bhargava. “Unlike BS III and BS IV that can make do with the inferior grade of fuel, BS VI vehicles simply cannot run on such fuel.”  Officials at OMCs said they are geared up for this.  A director of refineries at one of the oil marketing companies, who declined to be identified, said oil refinery firms including Reliance Industries, Bharat Oman Refineries Ltd (a joint venture company of Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd and Oman Oil SAOC, Sultanate of Oman) will be BS VI compliant. “Some of the other refiners will also be partially BS VI compliant and will be able to give quantities for testing in special batches,” he said.  In my last 50 years, I have not seen this kind of challenge. It’s far more difficult than most of the technical transformation that I have seen in my career- Rajan Wadhera, president automotive sector at Mahindra and Mahindra  Automakers are also seeking clarity from the government on whether the 1 April 2020 deadline, is applicable only for manufacturing or both manufacturing and registration of BS VI vehicles.  If it’s the latter, to ensure vehicles are available for registration from 1 April, auto companies will have to start manufacturing BS VI vehicles from the beginning of 2019, said Vishnu Mathur, director general at Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam). “There has to be enough clarity on the date of manufacturing and registration,” said Mathur.  Also, if the deadline is applicable for both, oil companies will have to also ensure fuel availability well in advance. The stock has to be ready before 1 April. “If it becomes registration, we have accepted a highly ambiguous target,” Mathur added.  Toyota’s Viswanathan agreed: “At the end of the day, we don’t want a relaxation. We want it only when it’s suddenly sprung on us.” If the timelines are well defined, adhered to not only by the auto firms but OMCs also, the transition will be smooth, he said.  The emission leap is an opportunity for Indian companies and those like Maruti with high volumes, to create an ecosystem for advance emission technology, said Rajeev Pratap Singh, auto sector head at Deloitte Consulting. “With automakers already exporting Euro VI vehicles to so many countries, technical know-how is not a challenge.”  It’s just that they will now have to develop the requisite technologies and capabilities locally as against importing them as the scale is much bigger now, said Singh. India’s car market is expected to reach 4.8 million by 2020, he said.  Come April 2020, India’s automobile market will change in more ways than one, as the industry leapfrogs to the strictest emission norms—Bharat Stage VI—from the current BS IV.

Conser","content":"Image copyright Alamy  It's no secret that Theresa May lost her majority in June's general election and that Jeremy Corbyn won more seats than expected. But what was really behind the decisions made by the UK's voters?  For the past three years the British Election Study has followed a panel of the same 30,000 voters - asking them hundreds of questions about their political views and choices on 13 occasions.  It offers the most detailed look at the issues which most concerned the electorate - and the results are now in.  It really was about Brexit  Despite Mrs May's claim that her reason for calling an early election was to get a mandate for the Brexit negotiations, the issue of Brexit itself had a relatively low profile during campaigning.  For much of the campaign, both the Conservatives and Labour focused on other issues.  But in the minds of the voters at least, the 2017 election was - as it promised to be ever since the referendum of June 2016 - the Brexit election.  This can be seen in our data in many different ways, but nowhere more clearly, perhaps, than in the answer to the question: \"As far as you're concerned, what is the single most important issue facing the country at the present time?\"  More than one in three people chose Brexit or the EU, compared with fewer than one in 10 who mentioned the NHS and one in 20 who suggested the economy.  The Europe question boosted the Tories and Labour  Of course, actions speak louder than words, and voters were not only concerned by Brexit but actually voted accordingly.  The issue cut across normal party loyalties and contributed to the revival of the Conservative and Labour parties at the expense of challenger parties - including UKIP, the SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Greens - which had done so well in 2015.  Because the British Election Study tracked the same voters during the 2015 election, the EU referendum and the 2017 election, we can see for the first time how voters switched party allegiance depending on their referendum vote.  version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?

More than half of UKIP's 2015 voters who voted again in 2017 switched to the Conservatives, compared with only 18% to Labour and a further 18% who stayed loyal.  Labour picked up a few Leave voters, but lost roughly equal numbers to the Conservatives - undoubtedly the party of Leave.  But which was the party of Remain?  Despite having the clearest pro-EU position and a promise of a second referendum, the Liberal Democrats failed to pick up many more Remain voters than they lost.  Instead, Labour, which was already the most popular party in 2015 among those who voted Remain in 2016, scooped the lion's share.  version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?

Not only did it win over a large number of Remainers from the Conservatives, but also from the pro-EU Greens and Lib Dems.  Overall, nearly two-thirds of 2015 Greens went to Labour, as well as about a quarter of Liberal Democrats.  How to say goodbye  One of the reasons Labour did so well among Remainers is that by the time the election was called, the Brexit debate was not so much about Leave or Remain but about how to leave.  The tens of thousands of voters we surveyed were asked whether it was more important for the government to \"protect Britain's access to the single market, or to gain full control of immigration\".  british_election_hard_soft_brexit_16x9 60% 50 40 30 20 10 Conservative Labour Lib Dem Probability of voting for party based on preference for soft or hard Brexit Single market access more important Controlling immigration more important Source: British Election Study  The results reveal a striking correlation between wanting to control immigration and voting Tory on one hand, and wanting access to the single market and voting Labour or Lib Dem on the other.  For example, the Conservatives lead Labour by more than 40 percentage points among those most in favour of full control of immigration, with Labour having a similar lead among those wanting complete access to the single market.  In effect this meant the Tories were the party of hard Brexit, while Labour was the party of soft Brexit.  The Lib Dems were not the first choice for those favouring a soft Brexit - possibly because of the lingering effects of coalition government, a perception of ineffective leadership and a realisation that they could not win in most seats.  One-way traffic  Although this was a Brexit election, it would be clearly wrong to say the election outcome was determined back in June 2016.  More than at any British election in recent memory, the election campaign really did matter.  Our pre-election survey, carried out in April and May, found that the Conservatives enjoyed a healthy lead over Labour of 41% to 27%.  version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?

of Leave voters Source: British Election Study  But by the last three days of the campaign, our daily panel put the two main parties neck and neck.  Overall, 19% of voters switched parties between the April/May survey and the election.  This is similar to the amount of \"churn\" we saw in 2015, when 17% of voters switched parties, and slightly less than at the 2010 and 2005 elections.  But the significant difference in 2017 was that the flow was overwhelmingly in one direction.  In 2015, Labour and the Conservatives both won about a quarter of these late-switching voters - effectively cancelling each other out.  However, in 2017 Labour won 54% of switchers, compared with 19% for the Conservatives.  Additionally, Labour won more than half of those who hadn't made up their minds before the campaign.  A question of leadership  The main reason that Labour did so well during the campaign is the strong performance of Jeremy Corbyn, especially relative to Theresa May.  At the start of the campaign, Mr Corbyn lagged far behind Mrs May in leader \"like scores\" - in which voters award a mark out of 10.  Mr Corbyn's score of 3.5 was slightly worse than predecessor Ed Miliband's at a similar point in 2015. However, by the end of the campaign Mr Corbyn had caught up with Mrs May, with both on 4.4.  british_election_party_leaders_liked_16x9 How leader likeability changed during campaign 5.0 4.8 4.6 4.4 4.2 4.0 3.8 3.6 A verage score out of 10 5 May 7 June Source: British Election Study Theresa May Jeremy Corbyn  And although Mrs May was still rated as the leader who would make the best prime minister, the gap had narrowed considerably.  Mr Corbyn's strong performance - or perhaps Mrs May's poor campaign - also meant that Labour closed the gap with the Conservatives when voters were asked which party was best placed to handle the issue they considered the most important for the country.  Over the course of the campaign Labour managed to broaden its appeal, winning over voters who were initially rather lukewarm about Mr Corbyn.  Labour also widened its appeal to more moderate voters on a number of issues, dramatically narrowing the gap with the Conservatives.  During the campaign, previously undecided left-leaning voters and supporters of a soft Brexit were most likely to switch to Labour.  Many of these had previously voted Labour in 2010 and 2015 and so perhaps were \"coming home\".  While this was undoubtedly the Brexit election, it was also a tale of two leaders and a campaign that mattered.  The Conservative strategy to pin so much on their \"strong and stable\" leader appears to have been a spectacular mistake which ultimately cost them an overall majority.

Theresa May's official spokesman made clear that freedom of movement will end in March 2019, despite previous indications from Mr Hammond that a similar system could continue after Brexit.  The No 10 spokesman said further details of exactly how the UK will manage immigration would be published in due course, but said it would be \"wrong to suggest\" freedom of movement would continue unchanged.  It comes amid reports of deepening cabinet splits over post-Brexit immigration, with one group of ministers led by Mr Hammond arguing for a system close to the current one and another wanting tougher controls.  Speaking on Monday, Ms May's spokesman said: \"Free movement will end in March 2019. We've published proposals on citizens' rights. Last week the Home Secretary said there would be a registration system for EU nationals arriving post-March 2019.  \"Other elements of the post-Brexit immigration system will be brought forward in due course.

Mr Hammond signalled free movement would continue for a three-year period in all but name after Brexit, with an added element of migrants having to register in the UK, while Ms Rudd sought to reassure business there would be no sudden drop in access to skilled EU workers.  Tensions then heightened after an interview with Brexit-backing International Trade Secretary Liam Fox was published, in which he insisted unregulated free movement after Brexit would “not keep faith” with the referendum result and highlighted that the Cabinet had agreed no stance.  There were reports that neither Mr Fox nor Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson were pre-briefed on the comments made by Mr Hammond or Ms Rudd, with Mr Johnson even forced to deny that he was preparing to resign over the issue – though Downing St said it did not recognise this version of events.  Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt joined the fray on Monday morning, defending the need for immigration from the EU and saying any post-Brexit deal must serve the need for the NHS to recruit staff from all over the continent. He said: \"It has to be a Brexit that works for business, it has to work for the NHS.  \"The NHS needs to recruit doctors and nurses from all over Europe and that is going to continue after we leave the European Union.\"  Boris Johnson didn't know about the major report into impact of Brexit  He added there would be no cliff-edge after Brexit and there would be an implementation period of no more than three years after the UK's exit in March 2019. Mr Hunt denied there were deep splits in the Cabinet over Brexit, instead claiming there was unity on securing a deal that restores control over Britain's laws, borders and money.  In a further sign he is softening the UK's approach to Brexit, Mr Hammond also gave an interview to Le Monde on Monday in which he downplayed claims Britain could try to become a Singapore-style low tax economy if it does not get the Brexit deal it wants.  He had himself suggested the move before the election, but told the French newspaper: \"I often hear it said that the UK is considering participating in unfair competition in regulation and tax. That is neither our plan nor our vision for the future. The amount of tax we raise as a percentage of our GDP puts us right in the middle of the pack.  \"We don't want that to change, even after we've left the EU. I would expect us to remain a country with a social, economic and cultural model that is recognisably European.\""},{"url":"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/08/01/brexit-fears-eu-doctor-exodus-may-unfounded-medics-apply-outside/","title":"Brexit fears over EU doctor exodus may be unfounded as more medics apply from outside Europe - Telegraph.co.uk","short_content":"A feared exodus of EU doctors as a result of Brexit is being eclipsed by greater numbers of foreign medics from outside the EU applying to work in Britain, new figures reveal.\nData from the General Medical Council (GMC), which regulates the profession, shows that the number of EU doctors granted a licence to practise in the UK between January last year and May this year fell by 8 per cent.\nHowever, the number of licences granted to doctors from outside Europe has increased by 17 per cent since the referendum in June last year.\nThe data from the medical watchdog reveals the situation among doctors does not reflect the drop in applications from EU nurses, which dropped from 1,304 in July 2016 to 46 in April this year.\nThe reduction in nursing applications has been partly attributed to more stringent language tests introduced by the Nursing and Midwifery Council.","content":"A feared exodus of EU doctors as a result of Brexit is being eclipsed by greater numbers of foreign medics from outside the EU applying to work in Britain, new figures reveal.

Two autonomous vehicles owned by suppliers Magna and Continental crossed the border between Canada and the United States on Monday, testing automated driving technology in a variety of settings.  The drive also highlighted a new memorandum of understanding between Ontario and Michigan, which, together, will help develop more autonomous vehicle technology and testing.  The vehicles, owned by Magna International and Continental, started their journey in southeast Michigan before a trip through the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel into Ontario.  They then traveled onward to cross the Blue Water Bridge, which connects Sarnia, Ontario, and Port Huron, Mich. From there, they headed about 300 miles to their final destination, Traverse City, Mich. They arrived at the CAR Management Briefing Seminars at about 4:45 p.m.  In a joint statement, the two suppliers, the Ontario Ministry of Transportation and the Michigan Department of Transportation called it “the first cross-border demonstration of its kind.”  MDOT director Kirk Steudle called it an \"unprecedented collaboration between two nations and private industry.\"  The two transportation regulators invited the suppliers to demonstrate their technologies as a way to highlight a new memorandum of understanding the departments will sign today. Under terms of the memorandum, the province and state agree to “further promote and foster growth of connected and autonomous technology testing and deployment, supporting both Michigan and Ontario’s economic interests and technological advancements by enabling job-creating growth for both jurisdictions.”  Cohesive partnership  “Today’s test drive is a great example of the continued collaboration and innovation between Ontario and Michigan,” Ontario Minister of Transportation Steven Del Duca said in a statement. This new memorandum of understanding and our recent commitment of $80 million for an Autonomous Vehicle Innovation Network signify the importance of a strong, cohesive partnership and continued investment in the development of AV/CV technologies and the mobility sector.”  Each supplier is testing some of its own technology used to make Level 3 autonomous driving possible. Level 3 autonomous driving requires a driver be at the wheel of the vehicle, ready to take control at a moment’s notice.  Through Continental’s own Cruising Chauffeur function, the two vehicles are able to take over driving tasks on various roadways in accordance with traffic regulations. Once Cruising Chauffeur is activated, data analyzed in a central control unit called Assisted and Automated Driving Control Unit is used to generate a 360-degree model of the vehicle’s surroundings.  Technology test  In combination with a high-resolution map, the system recognizes all moving and static objects, as well as the layout of the roadway ahead. The drive will demonstrate how the vehicles’ multiple camera, radar and lidar sensors will interact while being driven under the Detroit River through the concrete Detroit-Windsor Tunnel and across the steel Blue Water Bridge.  Continental confirmed to Automotive News back in May that it was conducting road tests in Ontario and housing the vehicles in their garage in Auburn Hills, Mich.  “Continental has been testing automated driving on public roads for more than five years and our approach is a global initiative. The engineering teams are spread across locations in the U.S., Europe, China and Japan to ensure driving and safety functions can be easily adapted to the individual regions as one comprehensive team effort,” Jeff Klei, president of Continental North America, said in a statement.  Top officials from Ontario, Michigan, Magna and Continental gathered at Monday's event.

Rick Snyder signed a package of bills enabling automated vehicles to operate on roads across the state. That year, Ontario became the first province to set a regulatory framework to permit testing of automated vehicles, making it the only province to have an automated vehicle pilot program in Canada.  “The deep integration of the Great Lakes Automotive cluster helps foster industry-leading innovation and allows companies on both sides of the border to compete around the globe,” Ontario Minister of Economic Development Brad Duguid said in a statement."},{"url":"https://asia.nikkei.com/Japan-Update/Toray-building-plant-for-electric-car-battery-parts-in-Europe","title":"Toray building plant for electric-car battery parts in Europe- Nikkei ... - Nikkei Asian Review","short_content":"On top of that and its Japanese production, it also will consider building a plant in the U.S., home to electric-vehicle makers such as Tesla.\nSweden's Volvo Car will make only electric or hybrid vehicles from 2019 onward, and Tesla began shipping mass-produced electric vehicles at the end of July.\nAs the vehicles' production expands worldwide, battery demand is expected to grow accordingly.\nJapanese materials makers have high global shares in mainstay lithium-ion battery parts, including separators, electrodes and electrolytes.\nSuch parts play an important role in improving the functionality of batteries that heavily influence an electric vehicle's performance, including its range.","content":"TOKYO -- Japan's Toray Industries will build a European plant to make parts for lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles, part of a 120 billion yen ($1.08 billion) spending plan through around 2020 that comes as the world gears up to leave fossil-fuel cars behind.  The materials giant's factory will produce separators -- films that partition batteries' positive and negative electrodes to prevent short circuits. Toray is the world's No. 2 maker of separators behind Japanese compatriot Asahi Kasei.  Toray hopes to have the factory, which will be capable of producing 80 million sq. meters of the films per year, completed by as soon as 2019, and is scouting possible locations, including in Germany and Eastern Europe. How much it will invest in the plant is not yet clear. The company aims to get a leg up on Asahi Kasei by entering Europe first.  Last fiscal year, Toray doubled its separator output capacity in South Korea. On top of that and its Japanese production, it also will consider building a plant in the U.S., home to electric-vehicle makers such as Tesla. With its planned investment, it aims to bring production capacity to 1.95 billion sq. meters, triple its estimated level for fiscal 2017.  The U.K. and France have vowed to ban sales of gasoline-powered vehicles by 2040. China has also classified electric vehicles and others with low environmental footprints as \"new energy vehicles,\" and will require them to make up a certain proportion of automakers' output there from 2018.  Sweden's Volvo Car will make only electric or hybrid vehicles from 2019 onward, and Tesla began shipping mass-produced electric vehicles at the end of July. As the vehicles' production expands worldwide, battery demand is expected to grow accordingly.  Japanese materials makers have high global shares in mainstay lithium-ion battery parts, including separators, electrodes and electrolytes. Such parts play an important role in improving the functionality of batteries that heavily influence an electric vehicle's performance, including its range. These Japanese makers are helping drive the expansion of the economy surrounding the vehicles.

Ministers say the agencies will be needed to deal with administrative tasks being moved from Brussels to the UK and will provide new careers for people living outside the capital.  The move could also save the public purse money with a lower cost of doing business, in particular around property prices, in the UK’s regions.  It follows an ongoing row over the Government's plan to leave the EU's atomic agency amid claims it could risk the country's power supply and access to life-saving medical treatments.  Cabinet Office Minister Chris Skidmore said among new offices established will be those required to run regulatory regimes currently under the watch of Brussels.  In an interview with Civil Service World, he said: “There are several organisations that will be created through Brexit.  “You’re looking at 20 plus public bodies being created through Brexit – and the commitment there is getting those outside of London.”  Tony Blair: It's necessary that Brexit doesn't happen  Mr Skidmore argued moving public sector organisations outside of the south east would benefit social mobility and give young people in other areas a new kind of career to aspire to.  He said: “Actually getting those public organisations, whether it is the UK Statistics Authority in Newport or whether it is the Local Government Ombudsman in Coventry, [outside London] is not just about saving money.  “It is about giving people something to aspire to and to know that the Government is in their area.”  He said fellow Cabinet Office Minister Caroline Nokes, who has responsibility for government property, would make formal announcements in due course.  The Conservative manifesto pledged to relocate “significant numbers” of public sector workers to new administrative centres across the country.  But the the decision to leave some EU agencies has led to warnings that British sectors currently regulated by Brussels could be put at risk, such as the energy industry.

The years 2014 and 2015 are considered the most successful for FDI in the country 's textile industry.

In Binh Duong, Taiwan's Far Eastern Group raised its investment capital by $485.8 million in its polyester and synthetic fibre production project, Far Eastern Polytex (Vietnam) Ltd. The project was initiated in June 2015 with a registered investment capital of $274 million. This capital push makes the project one of the biggest to be certified in 2017 and will push the total registered investment to about $760 million.  In the northern province of Bac Ninh, Samsung Display Vietnam registered a $2.5 billion capital increase in its projects.

The project, consisting of a main factory, four finished product warehouses, a garage for workers, and other auxiliary structures, began operation in 2016 end. The company plans to build its factories in Vietnam to take advantage of the country's existing export markets.  According to VITAS vice chairman Le Tien Truong, textile projects attracting foreign capital after the United States withdrew from the TPP is a sign of conducive investment environment. The country's textile and apparel industry still benefits from a number of free trade agreement, such as the Vietnam-EU FTA, the Vietnam-South Korea FTA, and the Vietnam-Japan FTA.  The value of garment and textile exports in Vietnam, one of the largest textile exporters in Asia, has increased 3.6 times in the last decade, from $7.78 billion in 2007 to $28.02 in 2016, accounting for 16 per cent of total export turnover. The industry is expected to grow by 7 per cent in 2017, reaching $30 billion in total export value.  Competitive labour costs and preferential policies have made Vietnam the ideal destination for investors in the textile industry in recent years. FDI in the last decade has helped the country turn one of the five largest textile and apparel exporters in the world.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain is heading towards a Brexit disaster that could amount to the biggest muddle in its history unless finance minister Philip Hammond succeeds in achieving a less abrupt exit from the EU, former Conservative Party leader William Hague said.  Since May's failed gamble on a snap election last month, the future of Brexit has been thrown into question with squabbling between her ministers over the pace, tone and terms of Britain's departure from the club it joined in 1973.  May has faced public pressure to temper her plans for a clean break from the EU.  Hague, also a former foreign minister, said that there was a danger that some Brexit supporters were underestimating the risks of a sharp economic slowdown or even the possible stalling of Brexit talks with the EU.  \"There is the clear potential for Brexit to become the occasion of the greatest economic, diplomatic and constitutional muddle in the modern history of the UK, with unknowable consequences for the country, the Government and the Brexit project itself,\" Hague wrote in the Daily Telegraph.  Hague said that an approach to Brexit was needed that made the negotiations simpler, reduced the need for rushed legislation, reassured businesses and included staying in the single market during a transition period.  Hague, who campaigned to remain a member of the European Union, praised Chancellor of the Exchequer Hammond for seeking such an approach to the EU divorce.  \"This is seen by longstanding advocates of leaving as a 'soft' position or a climbdown. But in reality it is a plan to rescue Brexit from an approaching disaster,\" Hague said.  Hammond has said Britain should avoid disruption to businesses when it leaves the EU, and there should be a transition to allow economies to adjust.  That would mean no sharp change to immigration or trading rules after Brexit in March 2019, with the transition period possibly lasting until 2022, when the next election is due.

The EU and Japan  On 6 July, the world's media carried reports of a Free Trade Agreement between the EU and Japan.  This suited Japan (still angry that the US had walked out of the planned Trans-Pacific Partnership) and the EU (whose imminent collapse had been forecast in the UK and US since last year's UK Brexit vote). Japan and the EU were both able to present themselves as open, trade-oriented economies.  But absolutely nothing of substance had been agreed.  The EU's own announcement stressed that the negotiations on the alleged agreement \"are not concluded yet, therefore the published texts should be considered provisional and not final.\"  No timetable was announced for concluding negotiations – never mind moving on to getting legislatures to agree or officials hammering out implementation details.  Neither side said whether they expect to reach an implemented agreement within years or decades. Negotiations so far have already taken years; in fairness, a huge number of issues need to be addressed. But Japan's current 30% import duty on European shoes will not be eliminated until ten years after the agreement comes into force – and there is no published timetable for eliminating duty on textiles or apparel.  Agreeing more controversial issues – like how disputes will be settled, or the complexity of agricultural trade – could mean several more years before the deal comes into force. Or that it never actually materialises.  Though governments love announcing imminent trade deals, because it makes them look progressive, turning them into new rules takes forever. The EU announced an FTA with Vietnam in December 2015 and suggested it might be implemented in early 2018. EU leaders are now merely saying they will \"speed up review\" of it. There is not even a commitment to a date for starting ratification.  US commitments disappear  Some politicians seek credit for creating new trade deals. In the US, Donald Trump campaigned for office on the promise he'd take the US out of trade deals he thought were damaging the country.  Six months into office, his lack of progress is spectacular.  Republican leaders announced on 27 July that the party's mid-2016 commitment to impose higher duties on all imports was being dumped. The statement gave no details about future plans.  Negotiations on the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Mexico and Canada are due to start in mid-August, with US hopes for an end this year.  But there is no knowing how long US Congress will then take to approve what negotiators agree. Trump and the Republicans promised a year ago to repeal Barack Obama's healthcare bill but, on 28 July, the Republicans in Congress failed to agree on the details of the repeal, and have almost certainly now abandoned it.  On trade with China, loud threats of instant sanctions against Chinese trade dominated the November election. Since then, US manufacturers and their workers have been devastated by more and more dumping of foreign steel – much of it Chinese. But all Trump has managed to do is mouth vacuous threats no-one takes seriously any more. \"[China's] dumping steel and destroying our steel industry, they've been doing it for decades, and I'm stopping it. It'll stop,\" said Trump on 12 July. \"There are two ways: quotas and tariffs. Maybe I'll do both.\"  He's done neither. Trump seemed to convince himself in April that his negotiating skills could turn China into a kind of ally: both in dealing with North Korea and in finding new opportunities in China for US businesses. He's getting next to no help on either front, and seems to have given up honouring his public commitments.  But all these three areas of impotence display a more fundamental problem, which isn't unique to Trump.  Electorates don't share common views – or interests – on trade. Claiming to get tough with China was electorally popular. But though cheaper Chinese steel, for example, hurts American steel producers, it also ensures US steel users (like car-makers) stay competitive with manufacturers in other countries that tolerate cheap Chinese steel. Voters and businesses don't want a tough stance on China if it hurts them.  Brexit means – well, what exactly?  More than a year after the UK voted to leave the EU, its government has produced no realistic vision of its timetable for leaving or plans for its relations with the rest of the world thereafter.  But it will continue offering duty-free access for products from the world's poorest countries – like Bangladesh, Cambodia, Laos and Haiti. This is almost the only credible commitment it has made about trade relations after March 2019.  Even the effective leaving date is unclear. Prime Minister Theresa May, committed at the beginning of the year to leave at the end of March 2019.  But, as she went on holiday in late July, her Chancellor of the Exchequer, responsible for Britain's economy, claimed her team was united in wanting a subsequent three-year transition period in which practically all Britain's EU membership rights and obligations remain unchanged.  Almost immediately, Liam Fox, Britain's Minister for Overseas Trade, denied he accepted such a period, and other key Brexit supporters agreed with him. On 31 July, Mrs May's spokesman said some controls on people moving between the UK and the rest of Europe would be established in March 2019, but gave no details.  With no deputy appointed to run things in Mrs May's absence, and no scheduled meeting until early September to clarify government Brexit policy, confusion reigns.  At present, the UK government seems committed to re-establishing Customs checks on merchandise moving between Britain and its neighbours sometime between March 2019 and 2022. But no-one has any idea when.  And trade relations with others? As long as Britain has a frictionless trading relationship with the EU, it cannot have its own free trade deals with anyone else. Since no-one knows when Britain will quit its current frictionless EU deal, or what its post-membership EU deal will look like, only a fool would predict the kind of deal any other country would sign with Britain.  So no-one was surprised when Donald Trump claimed in early July that he had \"been working on a trade deal [with the UK] which will be a very, very big deal, a very powerful deal, great for both countries and I think we will have that done very, very quickly.\"  And no-one believed Trump had any idea what he was talking about.  Britain may or may not negotiate a deal with the US after it leaves the EU. But nothing any foreign statesman now says makes such deals likely until Britain really leaves the EU.  What happens if you translate politician-speak into plain English?  Well, it's not just what the politicos say. What the Japanese and Europeans announced was scrupulously accurate – but most media, though, turned it into a far bigger story than it was. That, of course was the plan.  Trump's statements aren't intended to predict what's going to happen: for him, they're what he thinks some audience wants to hear.  The UK government really doesn't have a plan for Brexit, except to keep its supporters content: when ministers announce common agreement on something, they're trying to pressure colleagues into agreeing it.  In plain English: as of 31 July, there is no imminent, significant change likely in the rules imposed on imports by the EU, UK, US or Japan between now and at least mid-2018.  However hard politicians want to persuade you differently.

But outside the limelight that shines on the latest EV drag race and claims of cars with 1,000 horsepower or more, the real focus of clean transportation advocates is on electric trucks, the work horses that carry freight and cargo.  The International Energy Agency believes keeping global temperature rises below 2º Celsius depends in large part upon the electrification of some 600 million vehicles worldwide — half of them trucks. “In Europe, less than 5% of vehicles are commercial vehicles or heavy duty trucks, but they contribute to almost 20% of greenhouse gas emissions,” says Ananth Srinivasan, mobility expert with research consultancy Frost & Sullivan.  In Melbourne, Australia, SEA Automotive is busy adding electric powertrains to to trucks manufactured in China by FAW. Tony Fairweather, CEO of SEA Automotive says his firm realized a few years ago that electric commercial vehicles were becoming economically viable much faster than predicted. “The components are cheaper every time we go to buy. There’s not many industries where that happens.”  Electric cars may drive 10 miles one day and 100 miles the next. They may also be used for long distance trips occasionally. But a truck usually follows a predictable daily route where the range needed is known in advance. That means most owners of electric trucks don’t need to worry about recharging their vehicles out on the road. That can be done at the end of the work day with charging equipment installed at the home location.  Cost is the deciding factor for most truck fleets. Fuel and maintenance take a big chunk of the budget for most trucks. Diesel engine repairs and transmission fixes are expensive. So is replacing the brakes on commercial vehicles. The electricity to recharge the batteries of electric trucks costs less than diesel fuel. Engine and transmission repairs are significantly reduced. And brakes last much longer thanks to the regenerative braking systems that help slow the vehicle when the driver lifts off the accelerator.  Where most car buyers are attracted by styling, commercial truck fleet operators are attracted by the bottom line. Because electric trucks cost less over the long haul, they are an especially attractive proposition for professional managers. Frost & Sullivan’s Srinivasan says it it easier for fleet owners to justify investment in electric vehicles because “when they look at the cost for miles traveled over, say, two years with an electric van versus one powered by petrol or diesel”, the financial benefits are obvious.  In Europe, Duetsche Post has begun manufacturing its own electric delivery vans and selling them to other businesses. In the US, Workhorse and XL Hybrids are leading the way. Nissan is marketing an electric version of its NV200 small van in many countries around the world. An electric truck may not be as sexy as a Tesla Model 3, but as more and more of them are placed into service, we will all be able to breathe a little bit easier.

Yes, plenty of individual Brexiteers are still glad that they voted to leave the European Union. But the uncertainty that still looms over the UK’s future in so many areas – trade, farming, immigration and more, means that in many sectors, Brexit is seen as a negative.  There’s some good news for Leavers today, though. The Charity Finance Group (CFG), which provides support for finance professionals working in the charity sector, has published a new report entitled ‘A Brexit that works for everyone’, analysing what would be the best option for Britain’s charity sector.      The answer, according to the report, is a ‘clean Brexit’, whereby Britain leaves both the Single Market and the EU customs union – as this would allow the Government the freedom to set tax rates. As Caron Bradshaw, the organisation’s Chief Executive, said: ‘The voluntary sector has been hindered in the past by VAT rules and state aid and now is the chance to overcome this and change the regulatory environment in which it works.’  The charity sector could still benefit from leaving the EU with a ‘less clean’ Brexit – but the government would have to negotiate a deal whereby the UK has complete freedom to change VAT rules and allows us to reform State Aid, among other things. At the moment, the CFG says, one of the biggest burdens facing the charity sector is irrecoverable VAT. Many people might think that charities are ‘tax free’, but an estimated £1.5 billion is given to HMRC by the charities sector each year. Freeing up this money would allow charities to employ more staff and do more good deeds, and the CFG’s own polling shows that 83% of the public agreed that donations to charities should not be taxed. If it means losing out on £1.5 bn a year though, the taxman might not agree.  There are many people who think that the UK should negotiate as hard as possible to remain in the Single Market post-Brexit, and who won’t agree with the CFG’s call for a ‘clean Brexit’. But it is at least good to see that some people and organisations have moved on from arguing about whether or not the vote to leave was the right one, and are trying to build positives from Brexit."},{"url":"http://www.businessinsider.com/oliver-wyman-banks-capital-hole-after-brexit-2017-8","title":"A Brexit exodus may cost London 40000 investment banking jobs - Business Insider","short_content":"International lenders may need to shift as many as 40,000 investment banking jobs to the European Union to maintain activities on the continent after Brexit, according to financial consultants Oliver Wyman.\nOliver Wyman is not alone in predicting a banking exodus.\nThis is driven by natural prudence and also regulators’ demands,” Oliver Wyman said.\nInvestment banks that use London as an EU base have started to unveil plans to move essential staff to Europe.\nBrexit will also be costly for European banks seeking to maintain access to UK markets.","content":"caption Brexit will be costly. source Paula Bronstein/Getty Images  LONDON – A banking exodus from London will be costly.  International lenders may need to shift as many as 40,000 investment banking jobs to the European Union to maintain activities on the continent after Brexit, according to financial consultants Oliver Wyman.  Banks may also have to pump as much as $50 billion in extra capital into EU subsidiaries “to support new European entities,” analysts at Oliver Wyman said in a report published on Tuesday.  Oliver Wyman is not alone in predicting a banking exodus. The Centre for London estimated last month that as many as 70,000 roles may be relocated from the City of London post-Brexit, while EY last year predicted 83,000 financial services jobs could be lost. Brussels think tank Bruegel made a more conservative forecast of 30,000 jobs lost.  A hard Brexit, in which there is no transitional deal to maintain the UK’s membership of the European Union’s single market, will “fragment the European wholesale banking market,” Oliver Wyman said. “It will also make it significantly less profitable.”  Under EU law at the moment, European banks can operate branches in the UK that do not need to be separately capitalised from the parent company abroad. International banks in the UK can do the same in Europe.  The use of this passport, which allows them access to the single market of 28 nations, is under threat following the Brexit vote in June 2016.  Banks are approaching the point of no return for implementing Brexit contingency plans, according to the report. The lack of certainty over the UK’s status when it leaves the EU in March 2019 – and the dwindling chance of a formal trade deal – is forcing their hand.  “So long as the outcomes of the Brexit negotiations remain unpredictable, banks must act as if a hard Brexit is coming. This is driven by natural prudence and also regulators’ demands,” Oliver Wyman said.  “Over the next six to 12 months, however, actions will be needed that are more costly and harder to reverse – such as injecting new capital into EU entities, moving employees, appointing senior management, and building dealing room infrastructure,” the report said.  Investment banks that use London as an EU base have started to unveil plans to move essential staff to Europe. On Monday, Japan’s biggest bank, MUFG said it will set up an EU subsidiary.  Brexit will also be costly for European banks seeking to maintain access to UK markets. They will need to inject as much as €40 billion (£35 billion) of capital into their UK operations in order to keep doing business in the country after Brexit, according to a report from Boston Consulting Group last year."},{"url":"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/08/01/brexit-chance-slash-food-prices-freeing-farmers-subsidy-straitjacket/","title":"Brexit is a chance to slash food prices while freeing our farmers from the subsidy straitjacket - Telegraph.co.uk","short_content":"We've noticed you're adblocking.\nWe rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.\nWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.\nThank you for your support.","content":"We've noticed you're adblocking.

Banks would need to raise up to $50 billion to support new operations in Europe if Britain crashes out of the union, according to a new report from the consultancy Oliver Wyman.  There would also be a major hit to jobs. Oliver Wyman estimates that 35,000 to 40,000 banking jobs would be lost over the long run if London is stripped of key businesses as a result of Brexit.  The report is a stark reminder that time is running out for the banks.  Oliver Wyman said the banking industry has spent the past year preparing for Brexit in ways that are not too costly -- for example by applying for licenses in other EU countries.  \"Over the next six to 12 months, however, actions will be needed that are more costly and harder to reverse -- such as injecting new capital into EU entities, moving employees, appointing senior management, and building... infrastructure,\" the report said.  Businesses have pressed Prime Minister Theresa May for more details on her plans for exit talks with the EU, which kicked off in June. Many companies have put investments on hold until there's more clarity.  Yet members of May's cabinet have made contradictory statements on Brexit policy in recent days, adding to the impression of confusion surrounding Britain's goals for Brexit talks.  Treasury chief Philip Hammond said Friday that EU migrants were unlikely to be turned away at the border after March 2019, so long as they register when coming in and out of the country.  But trade boss Liam Fox contradicted him over the weekend, telling the Sunday Times that the free movement of people between Britain and the EU would end with Brexit.  A spokesman for May stepped in on Monday, saying that free movement -- a guiding pillar of the EU -- would end when the U.K. leaves in March 2019.  Related: Brexit splits give Theresa May a holiday headache  Oliver Wyman argued that the uncertainty is already taking its toll on the financial industry.  \"So long as the outcomes of the Brexit negotiations remain unpredictable, banks must act as if a hard Brexit is coming,\" the consultancy said in its report. \"Some of the fragmentation and inefficiency that would result from a hard Brexit will likely occur even if a closer relationship between the U.K. and EU is ultimately negotiated.\"  Some banks have already announced they will move jobs away from London because of Brexit.  HSBC (HSBC) is establishing a new European headquarters in Paris, where it will move roughly 1,000 jobs. On Monday, the bank said that legal costs and relocation fees associated with Brexit will cost between $200 million and $300 million.  UBS (UBS), Deutsche Bank (DB), Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan (JPM) have also said they would relocated hundreds of jobs each.  Related: Is the U.K. headed for a recession?  There is evidence that Britain's economy is already slowing.

It's a price some are willing to pay.

The solution here is not to end the free movement of workers, but to strengthen union rights and enforce existing employment laws; both measures were in the Labour Party’s recent election manifesto.  It’s easy to see why Labour is choosing to focus on this aspect of immigration: Attacking exploitative bosses is a fit with the party’s framing of wider economic injustice. It’s also understandable why supporters cut Mr. Corbyn some slack on the issue. The veteran left-winger and his allies now in leadership positions have a yearslong record of campaigning on immigrants’ rights — even as previous Labour Party leaders seemingly competed with the Conservatives over who was “tougher” on immigration. That tradition of Labour’s triangulating on the issue was encapsulated by a horrible promotional mug during the 2015 election campaign that bore the slogan “Controls on Immigration,” issued under the former leader, Ed Miliband.

Some sections of the party are still urging Mr. Corbyn to harden his stance on the issue to appease the party’s traditional working-class base — which, according to this analysis, is never as ethnically diverse as, in actual fact, it is. Nevertheless, Labour will need to show how removing from millions of people the right to move and work freely across the European Union is a progressive policy.  This is not impossible. Arguably, free movement of labor has made migration harder for those outside the European Union, whereas a Labour Brexit policy could equalize the criteria for all. But this approach might go awry if the European Union makes preferential trade access for Britain contingent on preferential treatment of migrants from within the union. Plus, of course, Labour would still have to sell the policy to a public that wants more immigration controls. So we’re back to where we started.  And that’s the squeeze Labour is in. It faces a hostile national mood on immigration that has taken hold over decades and has many causes. The country’s inability to process its imperial past is compounded by constant migrant-bashing from the media and politicians. In 2008, an economic crash largely brought about by unfettered finance capitalism plunged people into nearly a decade of precarious work with low wages and minimal protections. That created a fertile breeding ground for the anti-immigrant rhetoric of the far right. And Brexit, stoked by a nationalist campaign that demonized migrants, fostered a climate in which race hate surged after the referendum.  The solution for Labour must be to be as bold in its desire to shift the migration narrative as it has been to move the national debate on economic issues. If the party is riding a progressive wave, there is an opportunity to bring more of the public on board — including people worried about immigration.  To an extent, this is already happening. Immigration was the dog that didn’t bark in the recent general election. Recent polls of the British public’s top concerns show immigration, which had consistently polled first, slipping down the list. One explanation could be that people now expect that Brexit will cause migration to drop; another could be that, with leaving the European Union now polling as people’s leading concern, Brexit is partly acting as a proxy for immigration. Yet, other polling suggests that in the Brexit negotiations themselves, people place a higher priority on their health services and the economy than on reducing immigration. The public may finally be receptive to the idea that without migrants, Britain’s economy will suffer.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  With policies like the nationalization of rail and energy companies, a higher minimum wage and higher taxes on the top 5 percent of earners, the Labour Party succeeded in recapturing some voters who had been won over by the pro-Brexit, anti-immigrant U.K. Independence Party. Thousands of Labour campaigners, enthused by the Corbyn leadership, engaged in doorstep discussions that destigmatized migrants by shifting blame for people’s hardships onto a more deserving target: the government.  Of course, racism is an animating force of its own. Bigotry is not tied to economic fortunes, and some will always resent hearing languages other than English spoken on their street. But those who hold such sentiments are a minority and not likely to support progressive parties, in any case. So it makes no sense for Labour to formulate its strategy with this cohort in mind.  Along with Britain’s labor unions, the Labour Party could work to promote the solidarity that already exists between British and non-British workers by drawing attention to recent campaigns fronted by migrants that, far from depressing wages, have secured better pay and conditions for all. A drive to unionize more migrant workers would help develop collectivist sympathies. Labour could push its manifesto pledges again after Parliament’s summer recess. An obvious example would be to follow through on its proposal to remove students from the overall migration numbers, a practice that pointlessly inflates figures, as well as depicting vital overseas students as a nuisance.  Most crucial in a hostile climate, the party’s language should stick with its manifesto promise that Labour “will not scapegoat migrants nor blame them for economic failures” — and sound less like Mr. Corbyn’s recent comments about foreign workers. Even optimistic experts agree that on the issue of immigration, long-incubated antipathies take time to change. But if it is possible to shift the mood on this, it is surely within the power of Labour’s current leadership, with its populist left-wing platform and an army of enthusiastic, progressive and campaign-ready supporters."},{"url":"http://www.rubbernews.com/article/20170801/NEWS/170809993/heating-cooling-needs-changing-with-autonomous-vehicles","title":"Heating, cooling needs changing with autonomous vehicles - RubberNews.com","short_content":"Heating, cooling needs changing with autonomous vehiclesTRAVERSE CITY, Mich.—Autonomous vehicles will shake up the supplier segment and create opportunities in how vehicles are heated and cooled.\nThe change will mean opportunities for new offerings, specifically in heating and cooling parts of the car.\nAs vehicles transform to the autonomous era and become lighter to meet emissions standards, many of today's components will evolve or be dropped, Robinet added.\nBut by remaining flexible, smaller suppliers can pivot to new opportunities, he said, identifying thermal as a rapidly growing field.\nAdditionally, temperature regulation for passengers is becoming increasingly localized—or catered to individual riders—requiring heating and cooling to come through seats, the floor and door panels.","content":"Heating, cooling needs changing with autonomous vehicles  TRAVERSE CITY, Mich.—Autonomous vehicles will shake up the supplier segment and create opportunities in how vehicles are heated and cooled.

The change will mean opportunities for new offerings, specifically in heating and cooling parts of the car.  \"We need to help suppliers understand the level and the gravity of the changes that are coming in the market,\" Robinet said. \"Some of the midsize suppliers stand the chance of being left behind if they aren't proactive in how they address the number of changes we see.\"  Large suppliers have been investing in the major trends, Robinet said, namely electrification, advanced driver assistance systems, connectivity and autonomous technology. The field is also becoming more crowded, as Silicon Valley startups turn to automotive and European Tier 2's come to the U.S. as European auto makers expand manufacturing capabilities here.  As vehicles transform to the autonomous era and become lighter to meet emissions standards, many of today's components will evolve or be dropped, Robinet added.  But by remaining flexible, smaller suppliers can pivot to new opportunities, he said, identifying thermal as a rapidly growing field. Maintaining battery and motor temperatures will be vital for electrified vehicles.  The growing number of electronics in autonomous vehicles—including the computer driving the car—will also require intensive temperature regulation. Additionally, temperature regulation for passengers is becoming increasingly localized—or catered to individual riders—requiring heating and cooling to come through seats, the floor and door panels.  \"Thermal, in our opinion, is a major growth area, but also a market that's very fragmented,\" Robinet said. \"There are interesting opportunities here.\"  Change in the supplier segment is undeniable, he said, but it won't necessarily spell doom for smaller companies that take advantage of new demands.  \"The sky is not falling,\" Robinet said. \"The number of changes over the next five years are going to be tremendous. That's going to set you up for the decade after that.\"  You can reach Katie Burke at kburke@crain.com -- Follow Katie on Twitter: @KatieGBurke"},{"url":"browse://www.autonews.com/article/20170801/OEM10/170809992/mahle-helps-automakers-cram-for-new-tests","title":"Mahle helps automakers cram for new tests","short_content":"Starting in September, automakers must pass a tougher laboratory emissions test called the worldwide harmonized light vehicle test procedure set by the European Commission.\nAutomakers will also be required to measure air pollutants emitted on the road, such as oxides of nitrogen, through real driving emissions, or RDE, test cycles.\nTo answer the call for more testing, Mahle is constructing the Real Driving Emissions Centre in Northampton.\n\"I think for all manufacturers, it's very high up on their priority list to understand the best way of streamlining the testing,\" Williams said.\n\"For us, it's how do we get as much accurate data as fast as possible to meet automakers' vehicle development and project timelines?\"","content":"Have an opinion about this story? Click here to submit a Letter to the Editor , and we may publish it in print.  For Mahle Powertrain, a crackdown on European emissions standards calls for a more advanced testing procedure to keep automakers in the clear — and some fast solutions to get the testing up and running.  Starting in September, automakers must pass a tougher laboratory emissions test called the worldwide harmonized light vehicle test procedure set by the European Commission. Automakers will also be required to measure air pollutants emitted on the road, such as oxides of nitrogen, through real driving emissions, or RDE, test cycles.  \"The biggest effect for me is the time it will take to develop powertrains to meet the new RDE requirements, because it has substantially increased the amount of development testing required to achieve RDE compliance,\" said Simon Williams, leader of RDE Development at Mahle Powertrain in Northampton, U.K., a unit of Germany's Mahle Group.  Vehicles will be driven at higher speeds and with higher engine loads for longer than under previous European emissions regulations. Portable emissions measurement systems are mounted to the back of vehicles to directly test the gas emitted from the tailpipes.  The new rules consist of multiple test cycles, which have increased to two hours, from an hour and a half. The tests measure temperature results from minus 7 to 35 degrees Celsius (19.4 to 95 degrees Fahrenheit). They look at an altitude of 0 to 1,300 meters (1,422 yards), and weigh a range of driving dynamics, such as harsher or lighter accelerating and braking.  \"You start to imagine this six-sided cube of different scenarios that could potentially cause you to fail your emissions target,\" Williams said. \"So you start increasing the amount of testing necessary to meet the RDE requirements.\"  To answer the call for more testing, Mahle is constructing the Real Driving Emissions Centre in Northampton. The center, which is to be completed in the second quarter of 2018, includes simulation chambers with altitude capabilities.  As a vehicle drives up a mountain in a test chamber \"pressure vessel,\" the gradient profile of the chamber adjusts temperature and air pressure so the vehicle undergoes the exact driving conditions of driving up a mountain.  Williams said the test center and its advanced technological capabilities enable Mahle to meet \"all the corners of the RDE requirements\" without leaving the Northampton site.  \"I think for all manufacturers, it's very high up on their priority list to understand the best way of streamlining the testing,\" Williams said. \"For us, it's how do we get as much accurate data as fast as possible to meet automakers' vehicle development and project timelines?\""},{"url":"https://www.just-style.com/comment/trade-tracker-july-trade-talk-more-show-than-substance_id131326.aspx","title":"Trade Tracker – July trade talk more show than substance | Apparel ... - just-style.com (subscription)","short_content":"The EU and JapanOn 6 July, the world's media carried reports of a Free Trade Agreement between the EU and Japan.\nThough governments love announcing imminent trade deals, because it makes them look progressive, turning them into new rules takes forever.\nUS commitments disappearSome politicians seek credit for creating new trade deals.\nOn trade with China, loud threats of instant sanctions against Chinese trade dominated the November election.\nSince no-one knows when Britain will quit its current frictionless EU deal, or what its post-membership EU deal will look like, only a fool would predict the kind of deal any other country would sign with Britain.","content":"While NAFTA negotiations are due to start mid-August, it is not known how long US Congress will then take to approve what is agreed  Despite claims of major trade changes throughout July by governments in the EU, Japan, the US and the UK, there is little that is likely to affect apparel importers or exporters for years, according to Mike Flanagan.  The EU and Japan  On 6 July, the world's media carried reports of a Free Trade Agreement between the EU and Japan.  This suited Japan (still angry that the US had walked out of the planned Trans-Pacific Partnership) and the EU (whose imminent collapse had been forecast in the UK and US since last year's UK Brexit vote). Japan and the EU were both able to present themselves as open, trade-oriented economies.  But absolutely nothing of substance had been agreed.  The EU's own announcement stressed that the negotiations on the alleged agreement \"are not concluded yet, therefore the published texts should be considered provisional and not final.\"  No timetable was announced for concluding negotiations – never mind moving on to getting legislatures to agree or officials hammering out implementation details.  Neither side said whether they expect to reach an implemented agreement within years or decades. Negotiations so far have already taken years; in fairness, a huge number of issues need to be addressed. But Japan's current 30% import duty on European shoes will not be eliminated until ten years after the agreement comes into force – and there is no published timetable for eliminating duty on textiles or apparel.  Agreeing more controversial issues – like how disputes will be settled, or the complexity of agricultural trade – could mean several more years before the deal comes into force. Or that it never actually materialises.  Though governments love announcing imminent trade deals, because it makes them look progressive, turning them into new rules takes forever. The EU announced an FTA with Vietnam in December 2015 and suggested it might be implemented in early 2018. EU leaders are now merely saying they will \"speed up review\" of it. There is not even a commitment to a date for starting ratification.  US commitments disappear  Some politicians seek credit for creating new trade deals. In the US, Donald Trump campaigned for office on the promise he'd take the US out of trade deals he thought were damaging the country.  Six months into office, his lack of progress is spectacular.  Republican leaders announced on 27 July that the party's mid-2016 commitment to impose higher duties on all imports was being dumped. The statement gave no details about future plans.  Negotiations on the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Mexico and Canada are due to start in mid-August, with US hopes for an end this year.  But there is no knowing how long US Congress will then take to approve what negotiators agree. Trump and the Republicans promised a year ago to repeal Barack Obama's healthcare bill but, on 28 July, the Republicans in Congress failed to agree on the details of the repeal, and have almost certainly now abandoned it.  On trade with China, loud threats of instant sanctions against Chinese trade dominated the November election. Since then, US manufacturers and their workers have been devastated by more and more dumping of foreign steel – much of it Chinese. But all Trump has managed to do is mouth vacuous threats no-one takes seriously any more. \"[China's] dumping steel and destroying our steel industry, they've been doing it for decades, and I'm stopping it. It'll stop,\" said Trump on 12 July. \"There are two ways: quotas and tariffs. Maybe I'll do both.\"  He's done neither. Trump seemed to convince himself in April that his negotiating skills could turn China into a kind of ally: both in dealing with North Korea and in finding new opportunities in China for US businesses. He's getting next to no help on either front, and seems to have given up honouring his public commitments.  But all these three areas of impotence display a more fundamental problem, which isn't unique to Trump.  Electorates don't share common views – or interests – on trade. Claiming to get tough with China was electorally popular. But though cheaper Chinese steel, for example, hurts American steel producers, it also ensures US steel users (like car-makers) stay competitive with manufacturers in other countries that tolerate cheap Chinese steel. Voters and businesses don't want a tough stance on China if it hurts them.  Brexit means – well, what exactly?  More than a year after the UK voted to leave the EU, its government has produced no realistic vision of its timetable for leaving or plans for its relations with the rest of the world thereafter.  But it will continue offering duty-free access for products from the world's poorest countries – like Bangladesh, Cambodia, Laos and Haiti. This is almost the only credible commitment it has made about trade relations after March 2019.  Even the effective leaving date is unclear. Prime Minister Theresa May, committed at the beginning of the year to leave at the end of March 2019.  But, as she went on holiday in late July, her Chancellor of the Exchequer, responsible for Britain's economy, claimed her team was united in wanting a subsequent three-year transition period in which practically all Britain's EU membership rights and obligations remain unchanged.  Almost immediately, Liam Fox, Britain's Minister for Overseas Trade, denied he accepted such a period, and other key Brexit supporters agreed with him. On 31 July, Mrs May's spokesman said some controls on people moving between the UK and the rest of Europe would be established in March 2019, but gave no details.  With no deputy appointed to run things in Mrs May's absence, and no scheduled meeting until early September to clarify government Brexit policy, confusion reigns.  At present, the UK government seems committed to re-establishing Customs checks on merchandise moving between Britain and its neighbours sometime between March 2019 and 2022. But no-one has any idea when.  And trade relations with others? As long as Britain has a frictionless trading relationship with the EU, it cannot have its own free trade deals with anyone else. Since no-one knows when Britain will quit its current frictionless EU deal, or what its post-membership EU deal will look like, only a fool would predict the kind of deal any other country would sign with Britain.  So no-one was surprised when Donald Trump claimed in early July that he had \"been working on a trade deal [with the UK] which will be a very, very big deal, a very powerful deal, great for both countries and I think we will have that done very, very quickly.\"  And no-one believed Trump had any idea what he was talking about.  Britain may or may not negotiate a deal with the US after it leaves the EU. But nothing any foreign statesman now says makes such deals likely until Britain really leaves the EU.  What happens if you translate politician-speak into plain English?  Well, it's not just what the politicos say. What the Japanese and Europeans announced was scrupulously accurate – but most media, though, turned it into a far bigger story than it was. That, of course was the plan.  Trump's statements aren't intended to predict what's going to happen: for him, they're what he thinks some audience wants to hear.  The UK government really doesn't have a plan for Brexit, except to keep its supporters content: when ministers announce common agreement on something, they're trying to pressure colleagues into agreeing it.  In plain English: as of 31 July, there is no imminent, significant change likely in the rules imposed on imports by the EU, UK, US or Japan between now and at least mid-2018.  However hard politicians want to persuade you differently.

MPs campaigning for a softer Brexit are increasingly concerned that the government’s EU withdrawal bill will not allow the UK to stay in the European Economic Area even temporarily before the final deal with the EU comes into force in around 2022.  But Labour MPs such as Stephen Kinnock, Chuka Umunna and Heidi Alexander are considering ways to work with some Tories to keep the UK in EEA, at least for a transitional period, when the bill comes to the House of Commons in early September. One option would be for a backbencher to table an amendment asking the UK to remain in the EEA during the post-Brexit transition.  One Conservative MP fighting against hard Brexit told the Guardian it could be the biggest battle of the EU withdrawal bill and that there was a chance of defeating the government unless it gave more guarantees about the transitional period.    No 10 has ruled out staying in the EEA, saying exit will happen automatically at the point of Brexit, and rejected an “off the shelf” arrangement based on EEA membership for the transitional period. Members of the EEA are part of the EU’s single market; existing non-EU members include Norway and Iceland.  However, Philip Hammond, the chancellor, is known to believe there is no time for the UK to negotiate a bespoke agreement with the EU and has told businesses it would be best to have an off-the-shelf arrangement, which would mirror the advantages of the single market and largely persist with free movement.  May is particularly vulnerable to defeat because it is understood that Labour wants to keep its option open on the issue and not rule out any routes that could avoid a cliff-edge Brexit in March 2019.  In a sign that there is common ground between Labour and some of the Tories pushing for a softer Brexit, Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, told the Guardian that he was planning to table amendments to the EU withdrawal bill to “ensure it is possible to achieve transitional arrangements on the same basic terms – including the single market and the customs union”.  He said the legislation in its current form was not acceptable, partly because it “dismantles the apparatus of the single market and the customs union and it extinguishes any role for the European court of justice”.  Any alliance between Labour and Conservatives pushing for a soft Brexit would be dangerous for May, as her majority with the DUP has been slashed to 13. This means that as few as seven Tory rebels could spell a defeat for the government when the bill is debated in the Commons early in September, although they would be more likely to back an amendment tabled by a Labour backbencher than one of Jeremy Corbyn’s frontbench team.    If MPs voted in favour of staying in the EEA, the government would still argue as a point of law that the UK would necessarily leave at the EEA at the point of exit from the EU. However, it could choose to try to negotiate to remain in the EEA at an international level if parliament had made its wishes clear.  Supporters of staying in the EEA at least temporarily believe it is the best model for providing certainty for businesses without EU membership.  The idea was was backed on Tuesday by William Hague, the former foreign secretary, who said there was “clear potential for Brexit to become the occasion of the greatest economic, diplomatic and constitutional muddle in the modern history of the UK, with unknowable consequences for the country, the government and the Brexit project itself”.  He said Hammond’s plan for a transitional period of up to three years after March 2019 along the lines of an existing off-the-shelf model, such as staying in the European Economic Area, was the best way of trying to rescue Brexit.  Any suggestion that the UK could stay in the European Economic Area is also fiercely rejected by the hardest Brexit supporters. Steve Baker, the Brexit minister, said last month “it was like putting blood in the water to even talk about the EEA”.    But it is legally uncertain whether the UK is able to leave the EEA without the permission of parliament, after the high court ruled this year that it was too soon to make a judgment. As recently as March, David Davis, the Brexit secretary, said it was likely that parliament would have to have a say on any changes to the European Economic Area Act 1993, but since the election, there may now be no majority for exiting the EEA.  The official government position is that the UK will leave the EEA automatically when it leaves the EU, but a Whitehall source told the Guardian that view is not shared by all the government’s lawyers or ministers. In a plea for cross-party backing, Kinnock said: “The EEA is a well-established and well understood arrangement that allows us to leave the EU by walking calmly over a bridge rather than leaping recklessly off a cliff edge.”  Alexander said she was also “left wondering whether the chancellor has actually read the EU withdrawal bill”. “He might fancy the idea of staying in the EEA for a transition period, but the text of the government’s bill seeks to [dismantle] the EEA Act of 1993,” she added.  A spokesman for the Department for Exiting the EU said: “We have repeatedly made clear that we will not be members of the EEA after exit. The UK is a member of the EEA by virtue of our membership of the EU.  “Therefore, when we leave the EU, we will no longer be a member of the EEA. The purpose of the repeal bill is to create a functioning statute book. It does not provide the process for the UK to leave the EEA.”"},{"url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/01/opinion/brexit-isnt-good-for-britain.html","title":"Brexit Isn't Good for Britain - New York Times","short_content":"PhotoTo the Editor:Re “The Good News on Brexit They’re Not Telling You” (Op-Ed, nytimes.com, July 31):Daniel Hannan’s claim that it is chiefly opponents of Brexit who attribute the June 2016 referendum vote to anti-immigration feelings is extraordinary.\nIn recent days exactly that attribution was made in a BBC interview by his own Conservative Party colleague Liam Fox, the trade minister, who is negotiating the wondrous American-British deal that Mr. Hannan praises.\nAnd President Trump’s good friend Nigel Farage, a former leader of the U.K.\nIndependence Party, wrote in The Telegraph on July 25 that “the Great Brexit betrayal has begun” because the vote was all about — guess what?\nBILL EMMOTT, OXFORD, ENGLANDThe writer is an editor at InFacts, an anti-Brexit website, and a former editor in chief of The Economist.","content":"Photo  To the Editor:  Re “The Good News on Brexit They’re Not Telling You” (Op-Ed, nytimes.com, July 31):  Daniel Hannan’s claim that it is chiefly opponents of Brexit who attribute the June 2016 referendum vote to anti-immigration feelings is extraordinary.

The long-running British Election Study, which has followed a 30,000-strong panel of voters over the past three years, found Labour picked up significant support from remain-minded voters, despite its ambiguous stance on what sort of Brexit deal to pursue.  The latest set of data from the study team found that Brexit far outstripped any other single issue in the minds of voters prior to the election.  When asked to name the single most important subject facing the country, just over a third of the panel named Brexit, against about 10% each for terrorism and the NHS, with only about one in 20 citing the economy.  When actual votes were taken into account, the Conservatives were “the party of leave” at the 2017 election, according to Ed Fieldhouse and Chris Prosser from Manchester university, which jointly runs the election study.  They found that more than half of those who voted Ukip in 2015 and voted again in 2017 backed the Conservatives, with only 18% going to Labour and the same proportion supporting Ukip again. The Tories took more than 60% of the leave vote overall.  In contrast, people saw Labour as “the best bet for those wanting to keep closer ties with our European neighbours”, the researchers found, with the party winning remain votes from not just the Conservatives but also the more obviously pro-EU Liberal Democrats and Greens.  Noting that the Brexit debate by the time of the election was less about whether to leave the EU than how best to do it, the study found Labour took nearly two-thirds of 2015 Green votes, and about a quarter of Lib Dem ones.  One question, about whether it was more important for the government to protect access to the single market or get full control of immigration, showed answers clearly split across party lines.  Labour had a lead of more than 40 percentage points with voters seeking the first priority, with a similar margin for the Tories among those who favoured the latter option.  A series of polls of the panel ahead of the election uncovered how crucial the few weeks of the campaign proved in boosting Labour’s final result.  A pre-election survey in April and May found the Conservatives had a lead over Labour of 41% to 27%, but by the final days of the campaign this had turned into a virtual dead heat.  While the “churn” of voters – those who switched parties during the campaign – was similar to the 2015 election at 17% of votes, and slightly less than at the 2010 and 2005 elections, the primary difference was that in 2017 the switch mainly favoured Labour.  In 2015, Labour and the Conservatives both took about 25% of the late-moving votes, whereas in June, 54% went to Labour and just 19% to the Conservatives.  The authors said: “According to our data, the main reason that Labour gained so much in the campaign at the expense of the other parties is the strong performance of Jeremy Corbyn, especially relative to Theresa May.”"},{"url":"browse://electrek.co/2017/08/01/gm-chevy-bolt-evs-electric-car-deliveries/","title":"GM delivers record ~2,000 Chevy Bolt EVs – bringing total to over 10,000 all-electric cars","short_content":"Today, GM confirmed having delivered a record number of Chevy Bolt EVs in the US last month: 1,971 units.\nThe encouraging thing is that Bolt EV deliveries have been slowly but consistently trending up over the last 5 quarters.\nHere’s a chart of US deliveries since the launch in December 2016: But the increasing inventories are more worrying.\nLast month, GM confirmed that Bolt EV inventories increased from 104 days to 111 days in June.\nSmall crossovers, if you can call the Bolt EV a crossover, are more popular overseas than in the US.","content":"Today, GM confirmed having delivered a record number of Chevy Bolt EVs in the US last month: 1,971 units.

Toray is the world's No. 2 maker of separators behind Japanese compatriot Asahi Kasei.  Toray hopes to have the factory, which will be capable of producing 80 million sq. meters of the films per year, completed by as soon as 2019, and is scouting possible locations, including in Germany and Eastern Europe. How much it will invest in the plant is not yet clear. The company aims to get a leg up on Asahi Kasei by entering Europe first.  Last fiscal year, Toray doubled its separator output capacity in South Korea. On top of that and its Japanese production, it also will consider building a plant in the U.S., home to electric-vehicle makers such as Tesla. With its planned investment, it aims to bring production capacity to 1.95 billion sq. meters, triple its estimated level for fiscal 2017.  The U.K. and France have vowed to ban sales of gasoline-powered vehicles by 2040. China has also classified electric vehicles and others with low environmental footprints as \"new energy vehicles,\" and will require them to make up a certain proportion of automakers' output there from 2018.  Sweden's Volvo Car will make only electric or hybrid vehicles from 2019 onward, and Tesla began shipping mass-produced electric vehicles at the end of July. As the vehicles' production expands worldwide, battery demand is expected to grow accordingly.  Japanese materials makers have high global shares in mainstay lithium-ion battery parts, including separators, electrodes and electrolytes. Such parts play an important role in improving the functionality of batteries that heavily influence an electric vehicle's performance, including its range. These Japanese makers are helping drive the expansion of the economy surrounding the vehicles.

That should be alarming to anyone who cares about continuing the EU's resurgence since the 2016 vote.  “For the first time, I’m starting to believe that Brexit will not happen,\" Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said last week. \"I see encouraging signs that the tide is turning.\" Muscat is knowledgeable about the Brexit process: His country held the EU's rotating presidency in January through June.  \"Well I still hope that it won’t happen,\" Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said when asked about Brexit on Monday. He also knows more than most about Brexit because his country's border with the U.K. is one of the thorniest issues under negotiation.  There are good reasons why U.K. politicians, affiliated with both the government and the opposition, won't say similar things. Calling for another EU referendum did nothing for the Liberal Democrats in the June election. Most major figures in U.K. politics have pledged to respect the result of last year's Brexit vote. No one wants to be first with a risky reversal, even if some polls show that most Britons would now vote to remain in the EU. Foreign leaders such as Muscat and Varadkar have no such constraints, so their sudden optimism is a strong hint that the ground is shifting behind the scenes.  But those who, like Muscat and Varadkar, hope that Brexit won't actually happen should be careful what they wish for.  After the 2016 catharsis, the EU looks stronger both economically and politically. But it still has trouble defining its goals and even basic values, as evidenced by the current strife between Western and Eastern Europe. The easterners, led by Poland and Hungary, are pushing toward more authoritarian government and tougher measures to remain ethnically homogeneous. The Westerners stand on traditional liberal values and are softer on immigration despite pressure from right-wing parties. There are plenty of other divides, and new ones emerge constantly. Now, there's sudden tension between France and Italy over the former's decision to block the takeover of a major shipyard by an Italian company. French President Emmanuel Macron's foray into trying to settle the Libyan political crisis -- traditionally Italy's domain in Europe -- hasn't helped matters.  The EU bureaucracy and the bloc's core nations are trying to formulate a clearer common line on the union's future. The last thing they need is another centrifugal force -- and the U.K., with its current political establishment, would certainly be one. Even before Brexit burst into political reality, the U.K. was the most outvoted member state in the EU Council. Now, with millions of citizens who have voted against the EU, it would likely be even more contrary and anti-federalist.  The U.K. also had the most opt-outs of important EU policies -- the Schengen free travel area, the euro, the Charter of Fundamental Human Rights (the U.K. wanted to block the European Court of Justice from overruling its laws on Charter-related grounds) -- and, uniquely, a rebate on the EU budget. The U.K.'s ability to obtain these exemptions has inspired Eastern European countries -- whose English-speaking elites have long idolized Britain -- to seek their own opt-outs. If it hadn't been for the U.K. example, the euro area would probably be bigger today. When that example is eliminated, it will be easier for the EU to make a case for more uniformity and a closer union.  The U.K. is certainly to blame for Ireland's forced opt-out of the Schengen area: It would have wanted the travelers with Schengen visas to come without making a separate visit to the embassy, but seamless travel with the U.K. was more important. Even after Brexit, Ireland may be forced to stay out of the borderless area.  The scenario under which the U.K. comes back into the fold humbled and willing to accept everything -- the euro, Schengen, full ECJ jurisdiction -- or at least to make some concessions is probably what pro-European leaders such as Macron and German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble meant when they said they'd welcome a Brexit reversal. Such a turnaround, however, appears unrealistic. As long as brain surgery remains off the table, there's no way for the British public to change their minds so soon after making the decision to leave.  Clear thinking from leading voices in business, economics, politics, foreign affairs, culture, and more. Share the View  There is a better scenario for everyone than either a hard Brexit or a return to the pre-referendum status quo. It would involve the U.K. joining the European Free Trade Association, along with Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. Trade ties and current border arrangements would largely be preserved, but the U.K. would have no vote in Europe. It would stop being a centrifugal force, just as Norway isn't. Though U.K. politicians say the Norwegian scenario is not being considered, it's far easier to revive than full EU membership, perhaps for a transitional period first -- with an eye to making a transition to permanence. Britons didn't vote against EFTA membership in 2016. Simply not overdoing Brexit would be better than forcing it or reversing it.

Except when it comes to golf.  Donald Trump seemed less than awestruck when talking about his late mother’s homeland in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, observing: “You don’t hear the word Britain any more.”  Whereas American anglophiles are stereotypically enamoured of the Beatles, Downton Abbey and the royal family, the US president’s most urgent concern appears to be the implications of Scottish independence for the Open golf championship.  Trump spoke last week to Gerard Baker, the British-born editor of the Journal, which published excerpts of the interview, but the full transcript was only subsequently obtained by the Politico website and released on Tuesday.  After a discursive discussion about healthcare, jobs and their respective families, Baker noted that Trump had tweeted that morning about trade talks with Britain and asked if could provide more details.  Environment agencies oppose Trump plans for Scottish golf course Read more  The president replied: “No, but I can say that we’re going to be very involved with the UK. I mean, you don’t hear the word Britain any more. It’s very interesting. It’s like, nope.”  Brexit-besieged Downing Street will presumably be hoping that Trump meant that the term “Britain” has lost out to “the UK” in common usage, rather than that the country itself has fallen into obscurity.  The conversation moved on. Baker remarked that he is English. It was Trump’s turn to ask a question about Scottish independence: “Is Scotland going to go for the vote, by the way? You don’t see it. It would be terrible. They just went through hell.”  Baker indicated that he did not think there would be another independence referendum. The president, whose mother was from the Hebridean island of Lewis, seemed to dread the dissolution of the 310-year-old union, but not for the usual reasons.  “One little thing,” he said. “What would they do with the British Open if they ever got out? They’d no longer have the British Open.”  The No campaign never thought of that one.  Trump added: “Scotland. Keep it in Scotland.”  Trump golf course staff photographed urinating woman 'to detect crime' Read more  He and Baker then conversed about golf and the American star Jordan Spieth, whom Trump ranked alongside greats Tiger Woods and Jack Nicklaus.  The Wall Street Journal editor finally interjected: “Anyway, are you looking forward to doing a trade deal with the UK?”  Trump replied: “Yeah. I have a great relationship ...”  When Baker reminded him of the “ticking clock” of Brexit, the president said: “We have a very good relationship. I have a very good relationship with the prime minister. And we are absolutely looking to do a major trade deal.”  Baker followed up: “Would the idea be that the trade deal will kick in pretty much as soon as Brexit happens?”  Trump said: “As soon as it’s appropriate to have it kick in, absolutely. And it’ll be a big trade deal – much, much more business than we do right now, many, many times.”  He went on to criticise the European union as “very, very protectionist” but ducked a question about doing an agriculture deal with the UK by changing the subject to China. He did indicate he could do a services deal with the UK but again seemed anxious to avoid details.  Baker has denied giving Trump an easy ride in the Wall Street Journal’s coverage of his presidency. A spokesperson for the paper told Politico: “We published the noteworthy excerpts from the interview. We saw no reason to publish the crosstalk that inevitably accompanies any conversation.”  Trump spends numerous weekends playing golf – despite previously criticising Barack Obama’s similar outings. A new article in Sports Illustrated offers an insight into why.  It reports: “Chatting with some members before a recent round of golf, he explained his frequent appearances: ‘That White House is a real dump.’ Trump is often at his most unguarded among the people who pay for their proximity to him.”"},{"url":"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/brexit-construction-pmi-survey-a7872246.html","title":"Brexit: UK construction activity slumps to 11-month low as political uncertainty weighs - The Independent","short_content":"Construction activity slowed to an 11-month low in July on the back of political uncertainty and nervousness among businesses about Brexit according to the latest survey snapshot of the sector.\nThe commercial activity index slipped from 52.2 to 47.6, its lowest since the immediate aftermath of the Brexit referendum in June 2016.\nHousing construction activity also moderated, although remained in positive territory.\n“Worries about the economic outlook and heightened political uncertainty were key factors contributing to subdued demand.\nThe July PMI for services, which account for around 80 per cent of the UK economy, will be released on Thursday.","content":"Construction activity slowed to an 11-month low in July on the back of political uncertainty and nervousness among businesses about Brexit according to the latest survey snapshot of the sector.

It may not be Boris Johnson. But eventually a minister will break with this tottering government and establish himself (or herself, for it could be Andrea Leadsom) as the leader of the diehard right. Brexit is crying out for its Ludendorff; the scoundrel who can blame his failures on everyone but himself. The smart move for today’s right wing politicians who find their careers blocked is to break with the Tory leadership – whatever or whoever that may consist of – and resort to old slogans.  The referendum delivered a mandate to leave, Johnson, or whoever takes up the challenge of building a new nationalist right, could say. The failure of Brexit to deliver the bright confident morning the Brexiteers promised the British is not the fault of the leave campaigners. For how could it be? How could so many politicians, influence peddlers and journalists be wrong? No. The ‘elite’ has stabbed the people in the back.  I believe we are on the brink of seeing all the old warnings about the dangers of referendums being vindicated. Clement Attlee dismissed plebiscites as a device for dictators and demagogues precisely because they allowed complicated issues to be simplified to a binary choice. All referendums do that. Last year’s Brexit vote represented the reduction to absurdity in its clearest form, however.  Vote Leave dissolved as soon as the contest was won. The referendum thus dispensed with the most basic democratic requirements. The winners were not accountable for the promises they made. In their history of the campaign, Jason Farrell and Paul Goldsmith quote the Leave campaigner Gisela Stuart saying that she thought the referendum was an ‘abuse of democracy’ because no one who campaigned to leave was accountable for what happened next.  It seems a little rich of Ms Stuart to wring her hands now the rest of us must live with the consequences of the Brexit she fought for. But her point remains a good one. The leave campaign could make the most fantastic promises and tell straight-out lies because it need never live with the consequences.      In these circumstances, Brexit can mean whatever you want it to mean. Because the referendum boiled down all the complexities to a deceptively simple question, because the men and women who brought us leave are not answerable for their actions, the scope for demagogic politicians to claim the people have been betrayed is vast.  More than a year on after the referendum, with the Article 50 clock ticking, we still do not know what British policy is. It feels as if we are building to a great British foreign policy disaster: another Munich or Suez. What distinguishes 2017 from 1938 and 1956, however, is that the potential for disaster was ingrained in the referendum process. The Tories can put the party interest before the national interest and bicker among themselves because it settled none of the hard questions. For example, when Amber Rudd and Philip Hammond try to give companies and the government some breathing space by arguing for a transitional deal are they defying the people’s will or aren’t they?  Meanwhile, one senior civil servant source told the Financial Times:  There has been a failure of diplomacy. We have had the prime minister talking about no deal being better than a bad deal and [foreign secretary] Boris Johnson suggesting we aren’t bothered about getting a deal. The mood on the other side of the Channel is awful.  But because the referendum was not specific, Johnson and May could argue that a bad deal, which kept free movement and UK contributions to the EU budget, betrayed the referendum result. As the voters were not asked about the detail, any interpretation of the outcome is possible, and the most hard-line interpretation can sound the most plausible.  We deserve a public inquiry into this mess. If we could get one, it would surely look at how Brussels trounced Whitehall. As you will remember, Britain wanted to bundle all the talks together. The EU was having none of that. We would have to agree on the lump-sum payment and Ireland before the EU would talk to us about future trade agreements. Instead of worrying about a national humiliation, however, charlatans can consider the demagogic opportunities ahead. An unscrupulous politician (and Britain produces unscrupulous politicians as fast as BMW manufactures cars) could object to paying a penny towards the divorce bill. If we are leaving, we are leaving. Why should we give the EU tens of millions of pounds?  Given the vagueness of the referendum, any compromise can be repackaged as a betrayal. Vince Cable has already goaded Boris Johnson by suggesting he plans to lead the right-wing opposition from the backbenches. Johnson could and so could many others. They would have the support of the Express and the Mail, and possibly the Telegraph and the Sun. I guess a fair proportion of the 17 million who voted leave would back them too. They would prefer to hear that they have been betrayed than been foolish.  Theresa May threw away the last election by adopting an extremist position on Europe because she was more worried about being outflanked on the right than reassuring moderate opinion. She still could be outflanked on the right as could any of her successors. Brexit has made Tory government inherently unstable.  Stab-in-the-back theories were not only deployed by the Nazis and their predecessors to explain away the German defeat in World War I. They are a staple of democratic politics. Throughout its history, the left has heard variations on the theme that we would have had true socialism had not corrupt social democratic leaders sold the movement out. Right-wing stab in the back theories are not so different. Instead of the put-upon working class, they imagine the put-upon ‘people’ – usually racially defined. The people make their views known, they express their democratic will, only to be frustrated by the scheming elite.  Stab-in-the-back theories are incredibly powerful, for they pit the virtuous against the devious; the honest many against the sinister few. David Cameron opened the door for every opportunist to claim that the people’s will on Europe is being flouted. I think we are about to get right-wing and possibly far right-wing politics with a vengeance as a result."},{"url":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/02/ireland-uk-ambassador-sadness-brexit","title":"Ireland's departing UK ambassador shares 'sadness' over Brexit - The Guardian","short_content":"The departing Irish ambassador to the UK has expressed his personal “sadness” that Brexit is threatening to reverse decades of improving relations since peace was established 20 years ago.\nSuch a move would require British citizens in Ireland to show passports before boarding internal UK flights to Manchester or London.\nMulhall said the ideal solution was for the UK to remain in the customs union, obviating the need for customs checks.\nIrish exports to the UK have already taken a €500m hit because of the decline in sterling, and a hard Brexit would threaten relations further.\n“Our first hope would be … a decision on part of the British government to remain in the customs union or something akin to the customs union,” said Mulhall.","content":"The departing Irish ambassador to the UK has expressed his personal “sadness” that Brexit is threatening to reverse decades of improving relations since peace was established 20 years ago. Dan Mulhall said the border checks between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland were a non-starter and that Ireland’s “hope” was that Britain would remain in the customs union.  He made his remarks in a wide-ranging interview in the week that a political row broke out between the new Irish taoiseach and the Democratic Unionist party, who have said they will not countenance the border being moved to airports and ports. Such a move would require British citizens in Ireland to show passports before boarding internal UK flights to Manchester or London.  Mulhall said that all sides needed to abandon enmities and needed to be “willing to do things that maybe they wouldn’t ideally want to do”, because no one, including the DUP, has said they want a hard border in Ireland.  Young Irish think twice about living in Britain after Brexit Read more  Mulhall said Irish-British relations had been neglected in the referendum, but now needed to be part of the calculation because of the risk to peace and to trading relations. “It’s not acceptable to have a border on the island of Ireland because it would be economically disruptive and politically risky,” he said.  “You can’t have a border, it’s not practical. It’s a 300-mile border. It has no geographical basis – it’s not like the river Rhine is running along the border. It’s got hundreds of crossing points. It’s just not feasible to have a border. So you don’t try to do what you can’t do. We have to work out what it [the solution] is,” he said.  Last week, Ireland’s new taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, prompted a war of words when he declared that he would not “design a border for the Brexiteers”. The Dublin administration is unconvinced by the UK’s plans to use technology to maintain the invisible land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, which will become a boundary between Britain and the EU after Brexit.  Mulhall said the ideal solution was for the UK to remain in the customs union, obviating the need for customs checks. He believes Britain is only now realising the complexity of unravelling 44 years of public policy, and that both sides now face the “grind … [of] trying to bring these negotiations across the line in the next year and a half in a way that will avoid doing serious damage to Ireland, to British-Irish relations, and to the UK”.  “[We will devote] great determination and energy to achiev[ing] this goal, because it is not straightforward,” Mulhall added.  He described Brexit as a “black swan event” that had produced the “only dark cloud” on Ireland’s horizon, giving the country its “biggest economic, political and diplomatic challenge in the history of the state”. Irish exports to the UK have already taken a €500m hit because of the decline in sterling, and a hard Brexit would threaten relations further.  I feel a degree of sadness that I have had to witness this during the latter part of what has been a very exciting and enjoyable posting”  “We’ve already taken a degree of pain from Brexit – this is why I feel so sad – and to some extend, discomfited, because it has come at a time when our relationship was at a peak of satisfaction and friendship,” Mulhall said. “I feel a degree of sadness personally that I have had to witness this during the latter part of what has been a very exciting and enjoyable posting [in London].”  He predicts that deals can be done only when all political sides are ready to find a solution: “The negotiation process involves finding that magic space where both sides can feel their interests are covered.”  On future relations between the UK and the EU, he forecast that remaining in the customs union was an option because Theresa May’s remarks on this issues were “nuanced” in her Lancaster House speech. This is what Ireland will be pushing for, because that would also mean no tariffs on the €50bn annual trade between the republic and Britain, which includes sale in both directions of agrifood, pharmaceuticals and services.  “Our first hope would be … a decision on part of the British government to remain in the customs union or something akin to the customs union,” said Mulhall. He said it could be a tailor-made “special arrangement between the UK and the EU on customs.”  Mulhall, who has been posted to Washington, also dismisses the fears of some business leaders that the UK will become “a Singapore” which would try to lure business from Europe with a low-tax regime. That, he said, would be “contentious” and make it “next to impossible to secure access to EU markets”."},{"url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/31/opinion/brexit-european-union-good-news.html","title":"The Good News on Brexit They're Not Telling You - New York Times","short_content":"Those among my friends who voted to stay in the European Union didn’t weigh and then dismiss the economic and democratic cases against membership; they never heard them.\nBut it’s only fair to contrast what has happened since the Brexit vote with what was predicted during the campaign.\nThey told us that the FTSE 100 index of leading companies’ share prices would collapse; in fact, British stocks performed strongly after the Brexit vote.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main storyIf you want a picture of Britain’s future relationship with the European Union, think of Canada’s with the United States.\nTwo years from now, in a similar vein, the European Union will have lost a bad tenant and gained a good neighbor.","content":"In fact, opinion polls before and after the vote concurred that the main issue for Leavers was democracy.

Rather than going to the source, people read allies’ reports of what the other side is supposed to have said. If a British person tells you that the vote was “all about immigration,” I can almost guarantee that you are talking to a Remainer. Those among my friends who voted to stay in the European Union didn’t weigh and then dismiss the economic and democratic cases against membership; they never heard them.  The same confirmation bias can be seen in their determination to find bad economic news. Here is a selection of British reports from the past two weeks: Unemployment fell again, as every month since the vote, to 1.49 million (from 1.67 million in June of last year); manufacturing orders are at their highest level since August 1988; retail sales, official figures show, are up 2.9 percent on this time last year.  Exports were up 10 percent year-on-year in May, helped by the long-overdue correction of the exchange rate. Remainers like to point to the fall in sterling, but rarely mention that, before the vote, the International Monetary Fund and the Bank of England agreed that Britain’s currency, seen as a haven from the travails of the euro, was artificially expensive.  Continental Europeans evidently still regard the British economy as attractive; more of them are working in Britain than ever before. As for the supposed decline of London, a number of European banks, including Deutsche Bank and ING, have grown their operations here since the referendum. Last year, Wells Fargo spent £300 million (about $392 million) on its new European headquarters — in London. The latest survey from the Robert Walters City Jobs Index, for July, reported that hiring in financial services was up 13 percent year-on-year.  You may think I’m prone to a confirmation bias of my own. But it’s only fair to contrast what has happened since the Brexit vote with what was predicted during the campaign. Remain campaigners told us to expect a recession in 2016; in fact, Britain grew faster in the six months after the referendum than in the six months before. They told us that the FTSE 100 index of leading companies’ share prices would collapse; in fact, British stocks performed strongly after the Brexit vote. They told us that Scotland would leave Britain; in fact, support for separatism has collapsed, and the Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has shelved her planned independence referendum.  Most people, whichever way they voted, are celebrating the good news. But a few Euro-fanatics, disproportionately prominent on the BBC and at The Financial Times, are acting like doomsday cultists, constantly postponing the date of their promised apocalypse. First, a Leave vote was supposed to wreck the economy. Then, it became “wait until we begin the disengagement.” Now it’s “wait until you see what a bad deal we get from the European Union.”  It’s odd. The people who are the most pro-union are generally the most convinced that the union will act in a self-harming way out of spite. I have a higher opinion of our European allies. But even if I didn’t, I’d still expect a deal. Adam Smith observed that “it is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest.” It is not from the benevolence of the European Union that we expect a free-trade agreement: Exchange makes everyone richer.

Two years from now, in a similar vein, the European Union will have lost a bad tenant and gained a good neighbor."},{"url":"http://www.politico.eu/article/whitehall-flexes-its-brexit-muscles/","title":"Whitehall flexes its Brexit muscles - POLITICO.eu","short_content":"10 are shaping the Brexit agenda | Dan Kitwood/Getty Images Brexit Files Insight Whitehall flexes its Brexit muscles Theresa May’s loss of authority has given a fillip to the civil service.\nBrexit policy is no longer being issued by decree from No.10 Downing Street.\nBut the sense of unshackling also extends to Whitehall and senior civil servants.\nSenior civil servants are speaking up for their department’s Brexit interests far more, one official said.\nNote Michael Gove’s free-flowing speech on agriculture, which announced a whole new agenda — green Brexit.","content":"British Home Secretary Amber Rudd's announcement that the government will seek expert advice on its post-Brexit immigration policy illustrates that forces outside No. 10 are shaping the Brexit agenda | Dan Kitwood/Getty Images Brexit Files Insight Whitehall flexes its Brexit muscles Theresa May’s loss of authority has given a fillip to the civil service.  Brexit policy is no longer being issued by decree from No.10 Downing Street.  Theresa May’s loss of personal authority after the election, and the hollowing out of her staff, has contributed to the liberation of Cabinet ministers like Philip Hammond and Liam Fox, who have been vying to shape the Brexit agenda since the election.  But the sense of unshackling also extends to Whitehall and senior civil servants.  Officials in Downing Street and in the wider civil service that POLITICO has spoken to in recent days all note a marked uptick in the confidence and assertiveness of individual Whitehall departments and their staff. Senior civil servants are speaking up for their department’s Brexit interests far more, one official said.  Departments and ministers have also felt more at liberty to shape their own messaging and agenda. Note Michael Gove’s free-flowing speech on agriculture, which announced a whole new agenda — green Brexit. Or Amber Rudd’s ownership of the major announcement that the government will seek expert advice on its post-Brexit immigration policy.  Post the election, May personally chairs and attends fewer of the influential Cabinet committees that shape broad government strategy, according to the Institute for Government; while the emollient figure of Damian Green, her first secretary of state, now chairs eight. He led none before the election and his promotion to what is effectively deputy prime minister.  The IfG has also found that the last five weeks have been some of the busiest of the year for official government announcements, with the week before parliamentary recess the single busiest. Some of this is down to the ordinary “take out the trash” approach of publishing things at the last minute, but it also reflects more self-confident government departments no longer terrified of upsetting No. 10 with off-message policy announcements or publications.  One of the key differences in the shaping of the Brexit strategy post election, officials say, is the absence of May’s joint chiefs of staff Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill, who were forced out after a revolt by Conservative MPs. Timothy and Hill took many of the key Brexit decisions themselves — drawing red lines under policies that left ministers and their officials hamstrung, one official said.  The “chiefs,” as they become known, would also demand that Whitehall departments come up with daily uncontroversial but newsworthy announcements that would often then be abandoned at the last minute, according to an insider in the prime minister’s office. That culture has changed since they left and people seem a lot happier, according to the official.  Now, a thousand flowers can bloom in Whitehall. The effect is already becoming clear and could lead to a far different Brexit to the one many thought possible only a few short months ago.  A green Brexit? A Norway-style Brexit? Now the civil service is back in the driving seat, the future is up for grabs.

The accounts filed by the problem child of the Wal-Mart family have just appeared at Companies House and they make for grim reading.  Profits sank by nearly a fifth to £791.7m in 2016, while same store sales fell by 5.7 per cent.  Asda’s “we’re the cheapest schtick” started to fail when Aldi and Lidl reached critical mass and people woke up to the fact that they’re cheaper still. The American owned grocer’s disappointing figures are the result.  To be fair, new boss Sean Clarke has at least stopped a rot that saw sales falling by record amounts at points last year.  Perhaps we should be consider him as Asda’s equivalent of Chancellor Philip Hammond: trying to fend off the wolves with a bad hand of cards.  Mr Clarke prescription for what ails the business he runs has been to slash the prices of some everyday items, and by quite a bit. Look see, we really are cheap!  But will that do any more than moderating a future of decline? Like the one Brexit Britain is facing?  Asda’s first quarter saw a 2.8 per cent fall in sales against 2.9 per cent in the previous quarter.  There were a few more crumbs of comfort from the latest batch of Kantar figures. Its most recent survey showed Asda in positive territory for the first time in ages.  But the 0.8 per cent increase in sales it had the troubled grocer recording still made it the laggard among the traditional big four, the other members of which ticked up by just over 2 per cent apiece.  So, as a positive, it was a bit like Brexiteers saying, well, we might be looking at getting shut out of the biggest free trading zone on planet earth, but look over there: New Zealand wants to do a deal so we can get tariff free lamb.  The difficulty for Asda is that whether lamb is tariff free or not, more and more people continue to hop over to Aldi and Lidl to buy it, and they’re still opening new shops all over the place.  There were recently rumours of it tabling a bid for B&M, the general merchandise discounter, in an attempt to try something new by diversifying the business, as Sainsbury’s has done with Argos and Tesco is trying to do with wholesaler Booker, assuming the Competition & Markets Authority allows it to.  But B&M has just announced a bid of its own, moving into convenience food with a £152m buy up of Northern grocer Heron Group, as that sub sector of the market rapidly consolidates and competition intensifies within it.

The CEO is pushing forward with his plan to build 2 to 3 million all-electric cars a year and unveil 30 new models by 2025 within all of Volkswagen’s brands. It’s among the most aggressive EV goals from legacy automakers.  Earlier this year, he made a comment about the reception to his move:  “There are definitely people who are longing for the old top-down leadership. I don’t know if you can imagine how difficult it is to change their mind-set.”  Yesterday, Wall Stree Journal reported on several comments made by upper managements about the electric car push. Here’s an example:  “What are you doing?” demanded one angry executive during a meeting of top managers last fall, referring to the CEO’s stress on shifting beyond conventional vehicles, according to people present. “You are driving the nails into our own coffin.”  That mentality is definitely still very present in the auto industry leadership. Mazda gave another example of it just yesterday.  Müller also reportedly hired several people from the tech industry and passed over auto industry veterans, which angered the existing leadership in the company.  It looks like he is having his way nevertheless.  Volkswagen’s first new electric car is coming under the Audi brand next year and the mass market push is supposedly coming the year after that (2019) with a vehicle that they have been positioning as a “Tesla Model 3-fighter”, but $7,000 to $8,000 cheaper.  A new WV all-electric crossover called I.D. Cross Concept is also planned for 2019, but both those cars are believed to only be available in Europe and China, which have more aggressive fuel consumption and zero-emission vehicle mandates.  VW also confirmed two new upcoming electric cars for US market, I.D. Lounge and I.D. AEROe, but those are planned for 2020 to 2022.  It sounds like we still have to wait a while to truly see if Müller can overcome the internal backlash over EVs at Volkswagen."},{"url":"https://www.ft.com/content/16b50be8-161c-38d3-83b8-14b04faa9580","title":"Brexit: can and should the UK remain in the EEA? - Financial Times","short_content":"Subscribe to read: Financial TimesBrexit: can and should the UK remain in the EEA?","content":"Subscribe to read: Financial Times  Brexit: can and should the UK remain in the EEA?"},{"url":"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-latest-news-european-medicines-agency-move-london-eu-cost-bill-520-million-nhs-europe-a7873226.html","title":"Brexit: UK faces £520m bill for moving the European Medicines Agency from London to the EU - The Independent","short_content":"The bill Britain must pay for moving the European Medicines Agency (EMA) from London after Brexit has soared to a staggering £520m, it has emerged.\nMaking Britain pay up should be part of “the negotiations on the withdrawal agreement”, which will restart at the end of the month, the EU has said.\nMeanwhile, Conservative MPs are calling on British businesses and the Government to poach the EMA’s scientists and experts for the UK’s own regulatory agency after Brexit.\nThe EMA has warned that up 667 of its 890 staff did not want to leave London, potentially “devastating” the agency’s work, the European Parliament’s budget committee has been told.\nThe EMA is responsible for the scientific evaluation, supervision and safety monitoring of all medicines marketed in the EU’s single market.","content":"The bill Britain must pay for moving the European Medicines Agency (EMA) from London after Brexit has soared to a staggering £520m, it has emerged.  The Liberal Democrats said the huge sum for relocating the agency – considered a jewel in the EU‘s crown, because it attracts businesses and experts – was among the most “crazy” aspects of withdrawal.  “One of the ludicrous ironies of Brexit is we could end up having to pay large amounts of money to lose highly skilled jobs and research capacity from the UK,” said Brexit spokesman Tom Brake.  “It really is that crazy. Rather than £350m a week extra for the NHS as the Brexiteers promised, Brexit is making us poorer every day.”  The EU insisted earlier this year that Britain must foot the bill for moving the EMA, because it is a direct consequence of the decision to leave the union.  Amsterdam, Barcelona, Copenhagen, Dublin, Lille, Porto, Stockholm and Bratislava are among 19 cities eager to compete for the prize of hosting the agency.  Now Brussels has put the cost of relocation at €582.5m (£520m), with 60 per cent of the costs the result of a botched rental contract for the EMA’s Canary Wharf offices.  The agency failed to negotiate a “break clause”, which means EU taxpayers are locked into a rent contract for its offices until June 30, 2039.  Making Britain pay up should be part of “the negotiations on the withdrawal agreement”, which will restart at the end of the month, the EU has said.  Mr Brake added: “There are around 40 EU agencies of which Britain may no longer be a part, but the government has absolutely no plan and no clue for what arrangements we will have in all these different areas post their extreme Brexit.  And Chris Leslie MP, a pro-EU Labour MP and supporter of the Open Britain campaign, said: “This is yet another price to be paid for the Government’s aim of a hard, destructive Brexit.  “Not only are hundreds of good jobs being shipped out of London thanks to the decision to leave the single market, but UK taxpayers are going to be left on the hook for the relocation costs too.  Meanwhile, Conservative MPs are calling on British businesses and the Government to poach the EMA’s scientists and experts for the UK’s own regulatory agency after Brexit.  The EMA has warned that up 667 of its 890 staff did not want to leave London, potentially “devastating” the agency’s work, the European Parliament’s budget committee has been told.  Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, a Tory backbencher, called for the EMA’s scientists and experts to be offered sweeteners to stay and prepare Britain’s pharmaceutical industry for Brexit.  “A lot of those people were involved in shaping the European legislation and I imagine our legislation will have to be very similar to the Europeans’,” he told The Daily Telegraph.  The EMA is responsible for the scientific evaluation, supervision and safety monitoring of all medicines marketed in the EU’s single market.  It also plays host to tens of thousands of national regulators and scientists each year from across the continent, who come to London each year as part of the approval process."}]
